	<h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">WHAT SOURCES DO YOU USE?</h2>
</div>

This question was asked mainly in the first weeks of the war, but now it only comes up sporadically, probably because the information that is being reported here is proving to be largely inaccurate. Nevertheless, I have long planned to write something about it in summary. The short answer could be given in one word with a preposition: from open sources. But now for the long answer: 

Information from open sources (OSINT - Open Source Intelligence) is a collection of everything that can be freely found in the digital space without having to go to primary sources and conduct your own investigative work. Often, you can find the same information on dozens of websites or profiles at the same time. My primary source of information is Twitter, although most of the information first appears on Russian- and Ukrainian-language Telegram.  From there, it is picked up by other profiles and English versions. 

OSINT information is commonly used today in investigative work (see, for example, Bellingcat) or to geolocate specific incidents. The advantage of this information is that it is fast. The disadvantage is that in order to interpret it, you need to monitor the situation constantly and form an overview in your head of what is likely and what is probably fake news. This was a problem mainly in the early days of the war, before reliable sources were sorted out. And "reliable" is the key word here. Each of the sources has been wrong at some point in the past, but their reliability is still close to 100%. 

But now to the specific sources from which most of the information you read here comes (TW, TG channels):
