    desc: 'After the new defence minister nominated by the SPD, Jaromír Zůna, declared
      at a press conference that Russia is the aggressor and that the Czech munitions
      initiative will continue, the SPD has been showing us for days what their "freedom"
      and "democracy" mean. Okamura''s fascist party first tried to "set the record
      straight" with Zůna''s statements, then deleted Zůna''s social media accounts,
      and then videos of Zůna and SPD member Radim Fiala surfaced, with Fiala literally
      telling Zůna what views and positions to take. The SPD also announced as a precautionary
      measure that Zůna would only comment on military matters and that he would leave
      foreign policy to Prime Minister Babiš. Meanwhile, the SPD''s coalition partner,
      the Motorists, have begun purging the Foreign Ministry through Macinka and firing
      long-time career diplomats. And this is what''s happening too [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0pBwrpNGbP5FpHbkpu851JUPzGkHcrwHXhHRtnZYbXvKZScQGc2VUA8JJSTFHNQbwl):

    title: Tuesday
    detail: '- The Washington Post reports that the Russian economy is in danger.
      Russia''s reserves are depleted, sanctions are hitting oil and banks hard, and
      2026 could bring a financial crisis. The Kremlin has spent most of the cash
      reserves and borrowed money that allowed it to finance record military spending.
      But because of the sanctions, Moscow is forced to sell oil at a discount of
      more than $20 a barrel, and oil and gas revenues, which are crucial to the Russian
      budget, are falling. At the same time, military spending has reached a record
      $149 billion this year. Russian bankers themselves are sounding the alarm about
      the rising level of non-performing loans in the banking system. High interest
      rates, which have now fallen to 16%, may be taming high inflation slightly,
      but they are contributing to a parallel reduction in corporate profits and cash
      reserves. As a result, investment has stalled, production in some sectors has
      fallen sharply and insolvencies have increased throughout the economy.

      - Russia has sent 635 drones and 38 missiles/shots to Ukraine. At least 13 regions
      were hit and at least four people were killed, including a four-year-old child.
      In Kiev, the alert over the air strike lasted for almost four and a half hours
      and it was only over the morning that it was announced that the danger had passed.
      In the Svyatoshynskyi district of Kiev, a drone hit a high-rise apartment building.
      In the Kiev region, the debris of a drone landed on a residential building and
      destroyed it. The greatest damage was caused to the energy infrastructure in
      the west of Ukraine. As a result, most of Ukraine is experiencing emergency
      power cuts and the Rivne region is almost entirely without electricity.

      - Russia is refusing to leave the consulate in Gdansk, which must be closed
      by midnight on the 23rd, following a decision by the Ministry of the Interior.
      If it goes to court, the eviction of the Russians could take years. Meanwhile,
      Moscow has not paid a single penny for the building since 2013, bringing the
      debt for unpaid fees and interest to nearly €2 million. The court has already
      ordered Russia to pay about €80,000 in interest on the late fees. But Russia
      ignored it. It is strikingly reminiscent of the situation in Prague.

      - Russian state propaganda has produced a new video in which actors playing
      Europeans at Christmas dinner blame everything bad that happens in their lives
      on Putin. For context, it should be added that ''Putin is to blame for everything''
      is not only the point of current Russian propaganda, but also a long-standing
      argument of the local fifth column, which has been consuming Russian propaganda
      for years.

      - The Venezuelan army has started handing out rifles to civilians in working-class
      neighbourhoods. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry has begun evacuating
      the families of diplomats from Venezuela. What are the chances that Trump traded
      the Russians'' departure from Venezuela for the US not intervening in Ukraine?

      - Babis announced that the Czech Security Council will decide on the future
      of the munitions initiative on January 7. In his words, it is a good thing,
      but it needs to be investigated to see if there was corruption involved.

      - According to the Financial Times, Putin has been receiving overly optimistic
      reports from the battlefield, leading him to believe that Russia is winning
      the war, when the reality is much more complicated.

      - The US is again increasing pressure on Greenland. Donald Trump''s special
      envoy for Greenland, Jeff Landry, has said that the island should become part
      of the United States.

      - The United States has banned all new foreign-made drones and related components
      on the grounds that they pose a risk of espionage and data leaks.

      - Without explanation, the United States has lifted sanctions on several companies
      previously accused of supporting the Russian military.

      - Over 1.19 million Russian soldiers have already died or suffered irreversible
      injuries in Ukraine, yet the Kremlin has not yet captured a single major city.

      - According to a recent Pentagon preliminary report, China expects to be able
      to wage and win a war over Taiwan by the end of 2027.

      - Finnish President Alexander Stubb signed a law raising the age for enlistment
      from 50 to 65 for all eligible draftees.

      - About 100 Russian soldiers remain in Kupjansk with almost no ammunition and
      no supplies reaching them.

      - Putin recalled Ambassador Alexander Zmeyevsky and replaced him with Anna Ponomareva.

      - Aidar officially announced that he was expanding to a regiment.

    desc: 'Since November 2023, Belarus has been implementing a classified state project
      to build an ammunition plant and create a complete production cycle for 122mm
      and 152mm artillery and rocket ammunition for the Russian army in Ukraine. Thus,
      Belarus continues to play the role of Russia''s forward base as well as its
      "bank", willingly providing whatever Putin asks for. That is why the steps taken
      by the current US administration to loosen some of the sanctions against Belarus
      in recent months are incredible. To allow Belarus to get its economy back on
      its feet now is to indirectly finance Russia''s invasion of Ukraine. And that''s
      what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02F2eSmxjURz5cdEpArHAyHjdVL4ywpEi4EzcM2esx1wRxw6imZGh44K5WXkr4JePgl):

    title: Monday
    detail: '- Sweden has detained the Russian cargo ship Adler, whose owner is subject
      to EU and US sanctions and is accused of transporting weapons used in the war
      against Ukraine. The ship was detained in Swedish territorial waters for not
      having a mandatory customs declaration. However, it was later released again
      by the Swedish coastguard without any charges being brought.

      - The head of the Russian Armed Forces'' Operational Training Department, Lieutenant
      General Sarvarov, was killed in a car explosion in Moscow. The explosion occurred
      when Sarvarov slammed on the brakes. As a result of the explosion, he suffered
      severe multiple injuries to his lower limbs from shrapnel and later died in
      hospital.

      - Video from the Ukrainian 92nd Brigade shows two Russian soldiers moving into
      position on horseback. One of them was probably killed by an FPV drone along
      with the animal, the other was thrown by the horse and escaped.

      - The head of a Ukrainian arms company, Anatoly Khrapchynsky, warned that Russia
      was producing about 20% more weapons, equipment and ammunition than it needed
      for the war with Ukraine. He says he is stockpiling supplies for potential operations
      in Europe.

      - The Serbian news server "Danas", citing Russian sources, reports that Serbian
      and Armenian banks have begun blocking financial transactions and even the bank
      accounts of Russian citizens living in the two countries.

      - Boris Titov, Putin''s special representative for relations with international
      organisations in the field of sustainable development, said that at least 40
      000 migrants from India may come to Russia for work next year.

      - Lithuania has supplied Ukraine with a thermal power plant. The operation lasted
      11 months and included 149 deliveries of technical equipment to enable emergency
      repairs to Ukraine''s energy infrastructure.

      - Intelligence services in NATO countries suspect Russia of working on a weapon
      that could disable entire constellations of satellites at once using clouds
      of tiny fragments in orbit.

      - In November 2025, China bought a record $961 million worth of gold from Russia,
      the largest single transaction in the precious metal in history.

      - In January 2026, NATO will open a second major military assistance centre
      on Romanian territory, creating a southern supply corridor to complement the
      existing Polish route via Rzeszów.

      - A working group is being set up in the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada to urgently
      address the issue of holding possible presidential elections under martial law.

      - Russian troops crossed the border in the Sumy region, entered the border village
      of Hraboske and took about fifty local residents back to Russia.

      - Ukrainian drones hit the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal in the village of Volna
      in the Krasnodar region. Two Russian oil tankers were also hit in the attack.

      - The Russian oil tanker Valery Gorchakov, which was hit by a drone near the

    desc: 'The Wall Street Journal claims that Putin himself chose Witkoff as his
      chief negotiator with the US. The Russian-US talks began after the Saudi prince
      gave Witkoff a message from the Kremlin: Putin is interested in meeting with
      him. But the Kremlin had a condition at the time: Witkoff must come alone, without
      CIA agents, diplomats, or even his own translator. During the first meeting,
      Putin was then to offer Witkoff the release of American Mark Fogel, sentenced
      in Russia to several years in prison for possession of a small amount of cannabis
      (Fogel was presumably detained precisely to serve as a hostage, and was indeed
      released after the negotiations). That Putin chose Witkoff in particular was
      no accident: Putin had studied psychological profiles of people in Trump''s
      inner circle, including the special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, but whom
      the Russian dictator considered too pro-Ukrainian. With Witkoff, he was clearly
      on target. Anyway, other [things] happened too(https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0TL1LRJeCTRDaeTQ4MwtAYvFXmH8bjKMqZmFC8i96XAKKHfZ5Gh3oyHVN5ruFH4PQl):

    title: Sunday
    detail: '- According to DeepState, the Russians again attempted to use the pipeline
      for infiltration and suffered heavy losses in the process. The attack took place
      on December 16 north of Novoplatonivka. Russian troops attempted to move through
      the pipeline leading from Svatovo to the Oskil River. However, the 77th Independent
      Air Brigade noticed that groups of Russians were coming out of the pipeline
      at several points and attacked them with bombing drones. As a result, 40 Russian
      soldiers were destroyed in their sector and all losses were documented on video.

      - A central gas pipeline in Russia''s Volgograd region was taken out of service
      on Thursday, indefinitely disrupting a route Russia uses to import up to 12
      billion cubic meters of gas a year from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Ukrainian
      military intelligence suggests that this is a consequence of its actions.

      - Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of the Ukrainian armed forces, was awarded
      France''s highest state decoration, the Legion of Honour, which is bestowed
      by the head of state for exceptional military or civilian merit.

      - Orbán: "Of course, Russia has been attacked in the past - by Napoleon, for
      example, right? And Hitler. (sarcastically) But now, of course, Kaja Kallas
      will ''succeed'' - that''s understood."

      - Ukraine''s Foreign Ministry is working to create a mechanism to allow Ukrainian
      citizens living abroad to vote in the next Ukrainian elections.

      - Russian collaborators flew a small drone carrying the Russian flag over Kiev
      for several minutes yesterday before security forces shot it down using electronic
      warfare systems.

      - Russia is turning the occupied Donbas into a base for recruiting soldiers
      and using financial debts to force Ukrainians into contracts with the military.

      - Kremlin official Kirill Dmitriev said after a meeting in the United States
      that Russia is preparing to cooperate with the United States in the Arctic.

      - Portugal will contribute $52 million to the PURL mechanism, which allows Ukraine
      to buy weapons from the United States.

      - Ukraine replaces the commanding officer of the Southern Air Force Command
      after repeated deadly Russian airstrikes in the Odessa region.

      - According to Ukrainian war veteran Mykola Melnyk, the battle for Slovyansk
      will begin as early as next year and is "inevitable."

      - The United States intercepts another tanker carrying a cargo of Venezuelan
      oil - this time belonging to a Chinese company.

      - Polish and Ukrainian representatives met in the town of Uhly to prepare for
      the exhumation of the victims of the Volyn tragedy.

      - Ukraine and Portugal signed an agreement on cooperation in the production
      of maritime drones.

      First, kamikaze Shahed drones and then a ballistic missile hit the bridge. The
      missile carried cluster munitions, which are designed to destroy live forces,

    desc: 'Putin has openly declared that the goal of the Russian invasion of Ukraine
      is to "liberate Russia''s historical territories". In doing so, he has de facto
      confirmed that all previous "reasons", such as the expansion of NATO, the alleged
      fascists in charge of Ukraine, or the alleged oppression of the Russian-speaking
      minority, are just lying propaganda to cover up the real reason for Russian
      aggression: imperialism. The smarter ones have known this for the last thirty
      years. Perhaps Putin''s admission will finally open the eyes of some. But the
      members of Russia''s fifth column will continue to parrot every lie that portrays
      Russia as a victim so that they don''t have to admit that they are nasty people
      cheering on a nasty regime. And that''s what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02CVEe2fpkmSJrETF7iY8ZXjdywcjLWaozy8uyD73ut8VqTXsyShArvRgr9iSJTQnl):

    title: Friday
    detail: "- The following information appeared on Ukrainian and many Russian channels:\
      \ the Ukrainian army hit a tanker belonging to the Russian shadow fleet in the\
      \ Mediterranean Sea. However, the oil on board was allegedly not oil, but persons\
      \ with links to the Russian government and members of the military intelligence\
      \ (GRU) responsible for drone spying across Europe, sabotage and other subversive\
      \ actions. Seven people were reportedly injured and two killed in the attack.\
      \ One of the two dead is believed to be Andrei Vladimirovich Averyanov, at the\
      \ time a GRU Major General. Averjanov was responsible for GRU activities primarily\
      \ on EU territory, but not only there. On Putin's orders, he had carried out\
      \ a number of operations abroad in recent years. He was also supposed to have\
      \ been involved in the bombing of Prigozhin's plane or the Novichok poisoning\
      \ in Britain. But pending confirmation from official sources, the report should\
      \ be taken with a grain of salt.\n- According to the intelligence services and\
      \ militaries of several European countries, it is increasingly common for military\
      \ personnel or members of private armies, such as the Wagner family, to be present\
      \ on ships belonging to the Russian shadow fleet. In addition, it is reportedly\
      \ apparent that armed personnel are on board not only to defend the ship, but\
      \ in fact control the ship. Therefore, it is believed that the tankers both\
      \ serve a reconnaissance function and also serve as floating bases for subversive\
      \ actions. This correlates with the previous report.  \n- Russia lured two Colombians\
      \ to work as welders for $2,500 a month. But in Ufa, their passports were confiscated\
      \ and the pair were given rifles instead of welders. Three of the original seven\
      \ members of the hit squad they were assigned to are now dead. These two survived\
      \ and surrendered without firing a single shot.\n- Russia has been trying for\
      \ days to cut off the western part of the Odessa region from the rest of it.\
      \ Russian Geran drones have repeatedly attacked bridges there in large swarms.\
      \ On 18 December, one such drone hit a civilian car travelling on a bridge,\
      \ killing the woman driver and injuring her three children.\n- Ukrainian intelligence\
      \ has used drones to hit another Russian oil platform in the Caspian Sea. This\
      \ is the fourth attack and the third oil platform hit. The last attack was against\
      \ a platform in the Rakushchenskoye area, named after Valery Graifer.\n- Pavel\
      \ Gubarev, the former occupation chief of Donetsk, claims that Chechen Kadyrov's\
      \ forces from the Akhmat militia did not fight in the occupied territories of\
      \ Ukraine, but only looted.\n- The new SPD-nominated defence minister announced\
      \ that the munitions initiative for Ukraine would continue and praised the outgoing\
      \ government for its project to buy F-35 fighter jets.\n- The European Parliament\
      \ voted in favour of the creation of a \"military Schengen\", which will allow\
      \ troops to cross borders within 24 hours in the event of a crisis.\n- The US\
      \ Treasury lifted sanctions on entities that supply components and technology\
      \ to the Russian and Iranian military industries.\n- In Switzerland, a court\
      \ found guilty a citizen who had participated in the fighting as a volunteer\
      \ soldier in the ranks of Ukraine.  \n- Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia\
      \ will not join the EU-wide funding of Ukraine.\n- Russia has begun to claim\
      \ that \"Old Finland\" (Vanha Suomi) is territory that belongs to Russia.\n\
      - According to Putin, some 700,000 Russian troops are now fighting on Ukrainian\
      \ territory.\n- Putin said on television that Ukraine had started the war with\
      \ Russia.\n- Ukraine has repatriated the remains of another 1,000 fallen soldiers.\n\
      - The crew of a Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter was killed in combat.\n- A stray\
      \ Russian Orlan drone crashed into Turkish territory.\n"

    desc: 'Ukrainian drones hit the Russian military airport Belbek in occupied Crimea.
      The airstrike destroyed a Russian MiG-31 fighter-bomber, which was fully armed
      with missiles at the time of the attack. The Pantsir-S2 air defence system,
      which was supposed to protect the airport from the drones, was also destroyed,
      as was the 92N6 radar belonging to the S-400 system and two other Nebo-SVU radars.
      These attacks are important not only because they weaken the Russian army, but
      also because they weaken the Russian military industry. Russia profits from
      its massive arms exports, especially to Africa, Asia and some countries in South
      America. And if its clients see on the ground that the systems are not working
      as they should on paper, countries will start looking for other suppliers. However,
      this is also happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02LH1g3PLkmE74Rj7JLN6R3bdrv7PBdPxBunt8sBv8jm6WkDPkikKQU4C6WpSc4eHul).

    title: Thursday
    detail: '- The US announced a massive military package for Taiwan, the largest
      ever. The package, worth over $11 billion, is to include: The US Armed Forces
      Tactical Operations Network (TMN), 82 HIMARS missile systems, 420 ATACMS tactical
      missile systems, 120 M109A7 Paladin self-propelled howitzers, 1,545 TOW missiles,
      1,050 Javelin anti-tank missiles, parts for Harpoon anti-ship missiles, ALTIUS-600M
      and 700M drones, and spare parts for AH-1W SuperCobra attack helicopters.

      - On the Zaporizhzhya front, a cynical system of corruption operates within
      the Russian military. A group of soldiers pays their commander 50,000 rubles
      in cash every month to avoid the front. In return, they work in the army headquarters,
      where they are assigned fictitious "internal tasks" while official documents
      label them as combat mission participants in order to keep their higher pay
      and benefits.

      - On Wednesday morning, a trio of Russian border guards crossed the border with
      Estonia and were on Estonian territory for about 20 minutes. The Estonian authorities
      claim in official communications that this may have been a provocation, but
      it is equally possible that it was a mistake; however, given that it is impossible
      for the Russian border guards not to know which way the common border runs,
      it can be assumed that it was a provocation.

      - According to the Guardian, Russian military intelligence is conducting an
      intimidation campaign in which it is threatening Belgian officials. The aim
      is to prevent the transfer of frozen Russian currency reserves to Ukraine. At
      the same time, there are reports that the Americans are also discouraging European
      leaders from seizing Russian assets.

      - In a speech yesterday, Putin described European leaders as "underdogs". Today,
      Russian state propaganda ''explains'' that this is because they are the descendants
      of European Nazis with ''imperialist ambitions'' who are redrawing maps and
      dreaming of revenge for the Second World War. In short, classic Russian psychological
      projection.

      - The US Senate has approved a defence budget for fiscal year 2026 of more than
      900 billion dollars. The bill also includes $400 million for Ukraine as part
      of a programme to buy new weapons.

      - Erdoğan is offering Russia back its S-400 missile systems, reportedly unused
      as Turkey seeks to restore relations with the US and a potential purchase of
      F-35 fighter jets, which has been halted due to the acquisition of the air defense
      systems.

      - Trump justifies possible military intervention in Venezuela on the grounds
      that US companies until recently had licenses to extract Venezuelan oil, and
      that he thus wants to "take back what belongs to the United States".

      - According to Putin, "the objectives of the Special Military Operation must
      be fulfilled unconditionally". He also reiterated the need to occupy other Ukrainian
      territories and referred to Odessa as a "Russian city."

      - Tankers carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea have begun to take a detour
      along the coasts of Georgia and Turkey to reduce the risk of attacks by Ukrainian
      naval drones.

      - A fire broke out at the Ordzhonikidze plant in Saratov, Russia, a major industrial
      complex known for producing aerospace and defence equipment.

      - Britain is demanding that Abramovich hand over £2.5 billion from the sale
      of Chelsea to Ukraine. If he fails to do so, the funds will reportedly be obtained
      through the courts.

      - Russia sank several vessels at the entrance to the port of Novorossiysk, de
      facto barricading the Black Sea Fleet ships from the high seas.

      - According to TASS, Steve Witkoff handed Trump a crate of red caviar from Russia''s
      Khabarovsk region.

      - Ukraine hit an oil tanker in the port of Rostov, Russia, last night. Two crew
      members were killed and three others were injured.

      - The Russian army absorbed some territorial defence units in order to deploy
      them to the front.

      - Poland began production of anti-personnel mines for the first time since the
      end of the Cold War.

      - The EU approved a complete withdrawal from Russian gas by the end of 2027.

      - The Ukrainians regain control of about 90% of Kupyansk.

      convoy heading from the Pokrovsk region to the 3.5 km distant town of Hryshyn,
      believing that this would bypass the Ukrainian positions and cut off their supply
      routes. However, Ukrainian drones were constantly monitoring the area. Drone
      videos show that the entire convoy lay in ashes about a kilometre after take-off
      - several vehicles were hit simultaneously, suggesting that dozens of drones
      were waiting in advance in a convenient location for Russian vehicles to ambush.
      The final tally: 10 vehicles destroyed, around 40 soldiers killed. The surviving

    title: Wednesday
    detail: '- Investigators have released details of the recent brutal murder of
      21-year-old Danylo Kuzmin, the son of the deputy mayor of Kharkiv, in Vienna.
      Kuzmin was lured into a trap in the underground garage of the luxury Sofitel
      hotel by his 19-year-old compatriot and his 45-year-old accomplice. In the garage,
      he was brutally beaten so badly that Kuzmin had almost no teeth left. During
      the torture, Kuzmin revealed the passwords to two crypto wallets containing
      $200,000 in cryptocurrency. The badly injured Kuzmin was then placed in the
      back seat of a Mercedes belonging to his father and taken to the Donaustadt
      district of Vienna, where the perpetrators set the car on fire with Kuzmin still
      alive inside. On the basis of footage from hotel cameras, the Viennese police
      quickly identified the suspects. The 45-year-old suspect is a former high-ranking
      official of the Odessa customs administration, while the 19-year-old is the
      son of a well-known businessman from Chernivtsi and the stepson of the Ukrainian
      ambassador to Bulgaria.

      - Overnight, Ukrainian forces carried out a series of airstrikes, hitting, for
      example, an oil refinery near Slavyansk-on-Kuban. The plant processes up to
      5.2 million tonnes of oil a year and directly supports the Russian army. Drones
      have also damaged high voltage power lines there. In addition, an attack on
      the Nikolayevskaya fuel depot in the Rostov region has been confirmed. Tanks
      as well as the river barge Kapitan Gibert were damaged. In the occupied Luhansk
      region, a field artillery ammunition depot belonging to one of the units was
      destroyed.

      - German Chancellor Merz says the security guarantees proposed by the United
      States would allow Western forces to "intervene against Russian incursions and
      attacks" in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine. In any case, Russia has announced
      in advance that it will not accept the presence of any Western troops in Ukraine.

      - German MP and military expert Kiesewetter clarified that yesterday''s information
      about 360,000 Russian troops on NATO''s borders should not be seen as an assessment
      of the real presence of Russian troops in Belarus, but that it was "based on
      a misinterpretation of broader estimates of the size of the army."

      - The US President has branded the Maduro regime a foreign terrorist organisation
      and announced a "complete and total blockade" of oil tankers sailing to and
      from Venezuela. Under international law, this is potentially an act of war,
      which requires congressional approval.

      - Nigel Farage''s biggest backer, who has just given £9 million in financial
      support to Reform UK, is financially linked to a platform that spreads Russian
      state propaganda and runs influence operations linked to Russian intelligence.

      - Russian Defence Minister Belousov: ''NATO began preparations for a conflict
      with Russia in the early 1930s. The policy of European countries and NATO creates
      real preconditions for the continuation of military actions in Ukraine in 2026."

      - Legal guarantees have not been enough to allay Belgium''s fears of Russian
      retaliation, and Italy, Malta, Bulgaria and now the Czech Republic are supporting
      Belgium''s call for alternative ways to finance Ukraine''s reconstruction.

      - The European Union has added Diana Panchenko, a Russian propagandist of Ukrainian
      origin, to the sanctions list. The one that Rajchl claimed was an "independent,
      award-winning journalist with whom he is in contact".

      - Washington is preparing a new package of sanctions, including measures targeting
      Russia''s energy sector, to increase pressure on Moscow if Putin rejects the
      proposed peace deal.

      - Boris Pistorius announced that Germany will extend military aid to Ukraine
      for 2026 by another 3 billion euros. This will bring the total aid to 11.5 billion
      euros, a new record.

      - Ukrainian troops continue to advance in and around Kupyansk in the Kharkiv
      region, where the Russians must now rely on drones to supply isolated troops.

      - Georgia''s parliament, controlled by the pro-Russian Georgian Sen party, has
      passed a law to abolish the anti-corruption office, which was set up on the
      recommendation of the EU.

      - 34 countries and the European Union signed a convention to establish a new
      compensation body, the International Commission on Compensation for Ukraine.

      - Slovakia granted asylum to Russian influence operation actor Artyom Marchevsky,
      despite a promise to the Czech BIS.

      - Solovyov: "We will have to destroy godforsaken Berlin again, re-enter Paris
      and liberate Vienna on the way."

      SDPR in Russia, was assassinated in Moscow.

      - Ukrainian forces liquidated Mykhailo Mishyn, former "DNR Minister of Sport",
      near Pokrovsk.

      - Ukrainian drones hit and destroyed a column of Russian S-400 systems in Rajevka
      near Belgorod.

      - Putin signed a law allowing the seizure of real estate in occupied territories.

      - Russian propaganda is now spreading claims that Zelensky is the owner of an
      Israeli passport.

      - A Russian "guided" aerial bomb landed on a block of flats in Zaporozhye today.

      several pupils at a local school. Videos on the networks show that the attacker
      explicitly targeted immigrants. He was wearing a T-shirt with "No Lives Matter"
      written on it and before the attack he actively addressed the pupils and asked
      which of them was a foreigner. Police said the attacker was a supporter of neo-Nazi
      movements. This is the second attack on a Russian school in two days.

      - British Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, Chief of the General Staff, said
      the country must prepare for a possible war with Russia. He said the risk of
      an attack was real and needed to be openly communicated not only to the military
      but also to ordinary people - families and households. The situation, he said,
      is the most dangerous in his entire career in the army.

      - The Swedish Navy has announced that armed personnel in Russian military uniforms
      are on board tankers carrying Russian oil and subject to sanctions. According

      Gulf of Finland.

    desc: 'Kiev and the whole of eastern Ukraine are just one step away from a widespread
      power outage, analysts say. At risk are key elements of the power grid that
      bring electricity from western Ukraine - where most of the production is now
      concentrated - to the east. According to the WP, the Kremlin is deliberately
      creating so-called "energy islands" to completely cut off entire regions from
      electricity production and a unified grid. This makes no military sense, of
      course. It is a deliberate terrorising of the civilian population, a psychological
      operation to force Ukraine to surrender through political pressure. And it is
      having an effect not only on the Ukrainian civilian population, but also on
      civilians in Western countries, where, in response, there is a growing sentiment
      of ''as long as the suffering stops, no matter how''. The Ukrainians themselves
      are much more resilient than some Westerners think. And a new opinion poll in
      Ukraine proves it. But I''d get ahead of myself, first this [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0X9bE5sXDEzqC43wCCL1MtdRMg65NWGUEcDhwcFHDVsw3Cwx4hxQCZBRdsJphz5pCl):

      '
    detail: '- According to AFP, the US delegation in Berlin is pressing Ukraine to
      surrender Donbas. The current proposal includes a "freeze" of the front, under
      which Ukraine would have to relinquish control of part of its territory. In
      Kiev, in any case, this proposal is not seen as a path to peace, but as a forced
      surrender.

      - Fascism in the world is on the rise. The ultra-conservative politician José
      Antonio Kast has been elected President of Chile. Kast is the son of a former
      Nazi Party member who moved to Chile after World War II and is an unapologetic
      admirer of dictator Augusto Pinochet.

      - Russia has begun recruiting mercenaries in Iran, offering a signing bonus
      of $20,000 and a monthly salary of $2,000 through Telegram. It is targeting
      economically vulnerable populations in a campaign that has already attracted
      18,000 foreigners from 128 countries.

      - According to the latest poll, 61% of Ukrainians support Zelensky as Ukraine''s
      leader. Fewer than a tenth of Ukrainians support holding elections during wartime.
      75% of Ukrainians oppose a "peace plan" if it includes territorial concessions.

      - German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told Die Welt that German authorities
      are investigating the recruitment of radical groups by foreign governments for
      sabotage and espionage.

      - "We don''t need any agreement, we don''t need any arrangement - we need the
      surrender of Ukraine."- Russian Ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin

      - Estonian President Alar Karis said Tallinn is ready to help Hungary pay fines
      if Budapest terminates its energy contracts with Russia.

      - Russia''s Yaroslavneftorgsintez refinery, which produces gasoline, diesel
      and aviation fuel, had to completely halt production after the Ukrainian strikes.

      - President Zelensky is proposing that Ukraine abandon its bid for NATO membership
      in exchange for firm security guarantees from the West.

      - Fugitive former Syrian President Bashar Assad has decided to start a new life
      in Russia - he has become an ophthalmologist and is treating Moscow''s elite.

      - The US envoy says Belarus will release another 1 000 political prisoners in
      the coming weeks.

    desc: 'Austria has uncovered a conspiracy network organised by the Russian FSB
      posing as "Ukrainian Nazis". The network was coordinated by a native Austrian
      who has long worked for the Russian intelligence services. From 2022, he and
      a colleague - a Bulgarian citizen who was later arrested in London - organised
      the production and pasting of stickers and spray-painting of graffiti with far-right
      and neo-Nazi symbols in public places. All these actions were aimed at giving
      the impression that neo-Nazi symbols were being spread by Ukrainians. In addition,
      the two men, in cooperation with others, created a network of websites that
      mimicked the European branches of the Ukrainian Azov regiment. According to
      the investigation, the psychological operation did not only concern Austria,
      but also other European countries. In short, there are so many Nazis in Ukraine
      that Russian intelligence has to constantly invent them. And that''s what''s
      happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0UxuYbYPYVZ712tqkV8xgFxwvUiWWw8eCrFbdejL8Ty2RCcFZKiQFmcsAg8V7GukDl):

    detail: '- Prisoners who were released during some of the exchanges for Russian
      soldiers described what is known in Russian prisons and prison camps as a "gentleman''s
      kit": suffocation with plastic bags, electric shocks to the genitals, breaking
      of fingers, needles under the fingernails, and forcible removal of any pro-Ukrainian
      tattoos.

      - Ukrainian media report that Siversk in the Donetsk region, which Russian troops
      have been actively attacking since the end of October under the cover of a thick
      fog, has been almost completely captured and its recapture will require the
      deployment of reserves, which are currently lacking in this area.

      - The Russian Volunteer Corps fighting on the side of Ukraine (RDK) has called
      on all civil and political opposition forces in Russia to unite on a single
      platform and use Russia''s exclusion from PACE to become a legitimate international
      alternative to the Kremlin.

      - Pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash, who is being prosecuted in
      the U.S. for FCPA violations, won a court case in Austria and will not be extradited
      to the U.S. because U.S. prosecutors failed to meet a deadline for filing an
      appeal.

      - Russia''s oil and gas revenues in December are estimated to be almost half
      of the previous year''s level, at around 410 billion rubles ($5.17 billion).

      - Polish border guards uncovered a tunnel dug from Belarus to Poland that was
      being used by smugglers to move goods and people. At least three perpetrators
      were detained by investigators.

      - Ukraine is now facing up to 300 Russian attacks a day, the most since the
      war began, as Russia attacks along virtually the entire front line.

      - Belarus released 123 political prisoners yesterday, just hours after the US
      agreed to lift sanctions on Belarusian potash.

      - Mass protests erupted in Hungary over videos showing violence against children
      in state-run orphanages.

      - Estonia has begun construction of the first concrete bunkers along its south-eastern
      border with Russia as part of the Baltic defence line.

      - The Russians launched another airstrike on Odessa this morning. Explosions
      rocked the city for at least six hours straight. Russia is a terrorist state.

      - The Ukrainians hit two Russian fuel depots overnight - one near Volgograd,
      the other in occupied Crimea.

      - A Russian An-22 military transport plane with seven people on board crashed
      in Russia''s Ivanovo region.

    desc: 'Igor Girkin published another letter from prison: ''Ukraine is basing its
      strategy on the exhaustion of Russia, for us it is a protracted and fruitless
      war that is still going on. Many try to forget that the war has been going on
      for almost four years. During this time, we have not only failed to liberate
      Novorossiya, but also to clear the Donbas of the enemy. In the fourth year of
      the war, the enemy began attacking economic and infrastructural targets deep
      in the rear of the Russian Federation, which also does not indicate that we
      are winning the war. Yes, there are frequent reports from the front that we
      have liberated another settlement, but overall the enemy maintains the integrity
      of the front and his army has not collapsed. Therefore, unfortunately, we cannot
      say that victory has already been achieved or that it is very close. Production
      is falling, inflation is rising and economic difficulties are deepening, which
      can no longer be compensated for by drawing on reserves, because these reserves
      are already depleted. The state can no longer continue to wage war as it has
      done for four years, i.e. without switching to a war economy. And this is what
      our so-called "friends" are waiting for: that after a certain period of time
      the Russian economy will enter a spiral of decline, causing a collapse both
      on the front and in the home front, and they will win the war by attrition."
      And in the meantime, [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02YubFHUGMEDagE7T6UouFH1pUTJaCaNqBHZ1RzsCbgGi6KBqyT1RnLTfAsX6UAf17l)

      '
    detail: '- Russia is exploring ways to install radio frequency repeaters to guide
      Shahed drones on Ukrainian territory. It plans to use private properties and
      especially the elderly to do so. Therefore, the authorities warn people to alert
      their elderly parents and neighbours to pay extra attention to suspicious requests
      from unknown persons directed to install any boxes in the house or yard, which
      must be connected to an electrical outlet and, if possible, to the Internet.

      - Odessa is without electricity, water and heating after more than 300 Russian
      missiles and drones targeted civilian infrastructure there this morning. The
      outage has affected around 1 million people. Russia is thus systematically terrorising
      another city with a relatively large Russian-speaking population that the Russians
      falsely claim historically belongs to them. In total, Russia sent 465 drones
      and 30 missiles last night.

      - The Wall Street Journal reports that Russia''s advance in Ukraine has been
      slower than almost any major military operation of the past century. After nearly
      four years of war, Moscow still hasn''t conquered the Donetsk region, which
      has been its target since 2014.

      - Alexei Zhuravlyov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma''s defence committee,
      said in a Russian TV debate: "We have no choice but to keep fighting. We will
      stop in Kiev. All wars end in capitals."

      - Trump is going to bomb Venezuela - there will be ground strikes all over the
      country. Trump says the goal is to end the drug trade. But he also admits, none
      too covertly, that Venezuelan oil is the reason.

      - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has approved the participation of
      Russian and Belarusian youth athletes under their national flags in international
      junior events, including the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar.

      - Long-range drones manned by the SBU''s special Alpha unit again hit the Filanovsky
      oil rig in the Caspian Sea, but this time also the nearby Korchagin platform.

      - The US lifted sanctions on the Belaruskali production facility. Belaruskali
      is a large Belarusian state enterprise, one of the world''s largest producers
      and exporters of potash fertilizers.

      - The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was again without power overnight - for
      the twelfth time. The plant is believed to have lost all external power supplies.

      - Trump is reportedly prepared to provide Ukraine with NATO Article 5 style
      security guarantees in exchange for the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from
      the Donbas.

      - The commander of the Russian neo-Nazi battalion "Espaňola" with the call sign
      "Spaniard" (Czech: "Spaniard") was killed in fighting in Ukraine.

      - The US Congress has banned the Pentagon from unilaterally diverting weapons
      destined for Ukraine for other purposes.

    desc: 'The SBU says it has detained three suspected Russian agents in connection
      with yesterday''s bombing in Kiev that killed a National Guard member. The attack
      was carried out by three Ukrainians from the Odessa and Donetsk regions, aged
      23, 27 and 25. They all worked in construction and were recruited by the Russian
      FSB in an attempt to earn extra money through the Telegram app. Following instructions,
      they assembled homemade bombs, planted them and monitored the explosion via
      phones with online transmission. As a result of the attack, one National Guard
      member was killed and three others were injured. A second bomb exploded while
      emergency responders were on the scene. The lesson? If there is a military conflict,
      it won''t just be the Russians who try to kill you. It will also be your neighbours,
      acquaintances or even relatives - all those who have turned their failure in
      life into hatred of the democratic system. All those who are already swallowing

    detail: '- Zelensky visited Kupyansk and made a video of it. For the last few
      weeks, the Russians, including Putin himself, have claimed to have conquered
      (or "liberated") the city. The reality is that the Ukrainians managed to push
      the Russians out of most of the city during the counter-attacks and cut off
      several dozen Russian soldiers from supply routes. Thus, most of the city is
      once again under Ukrainian control.

      - Ukrainian armed forces, in cooperation with the Black Spark guerrilla group,
      hit two Russian ships off the coast of the Republic of Kalmykia in the Caspian
      Sea. The ships ''Composer Rachmaninov'' and ''Askar-Saridja'' were carrying
      weapons and military material. Both vessels were sunk.

      - Ukraine successfully struck the Slavneft-JANOS oil refinery in Yaroslavl Region,
      Russia - one of the largest refineries in Russia with an annual production capacity
      of around 15 million tonnes of oil and gas condensate. There were explosions
      and a large fire at the target site.

      - A Russian drone hit an evacuation vehicle of UAnimals, a non-profit animal
      protection organisation, in the Donetsk region. Two UAnimals employees and two
      animals were in the vehicle at the time of the attack. Fortunately, no one was
      killed.

      - The Russian Central Bank has filed a lawsuit in the Moscow Arbitration Court
      against the Belgian depository Euroclear, arguing that its actions caused harm
      by blocking access to Russian assets. Like... yes, that''s the point of the
      asset freeze.

      - Pakistan''s prime minister provided amusement for diplomats and security when
      he lost his temper and, after waiting 40 minutes for President Putin, stormed
      into the room where Putin was meeting with President Erdogan.

      - The famous Russian filmmaker Sokurov harshly criticized Putin during the video
      call, telling him that he was making Russia look like North Korea by banning
      all forms of creativity, and even in the days of the USSR it wasn''t that bad.

      - Bryan Lanza, who served as a senior adviser to US President Donald Trump during
      the 2024 election campaign, has become a consultant to the international division
      of Russian oil company Lukoil.

      - Russian channels are reporting that a Ukrainian drone attack on an AN-26 military
      transport plane at the Kacha airport in occupied Crimea has left personnel injured
      and dead, according to reports.

      - A supposedly more detailed version of the new US National Security Strategy
      has been leaked to the media, according to which the United States wants to
      persuade Austria, Italy, Hungary and Poland to leave the European Union.

      - Russians hit a Turkish ship in Odessa port. According to preliminary information,
      the ship was carrying generators. This is another piece in the puzzle of anti-Russian
      propaganda about "not attacking civilian targets".

      - US "Secretary of War" Hegseth has excluded Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll
      from negotiations on Ukraine. The reason is Driscoll''s "overly proactive stance."

      - NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned, "We must be prepared for a war on
      the scale experienced by our grandparents and great-grandparents."

      - Outgoing Prime Minister Fiala announced that the Czech Republic had delivered
      the promised 1 800 000 pieces of artillery ammunition to Ukraine this year through
      the Ammunition Initiative.

      - Outbreaks of Hong Kong flu have occurred in 17 regions of Russia, mainly in

      proposal. Territories: the US proposes to legitimise Russia''s control over
      Crimea, the "LNR and DNR". Any future changes in status could only be made through
      diplomatic channels. Donetsk Oblast: A demilitarized zone would be created covering
      about 30% of Donetsk. Ukrainian and Russian forces will withdraw beyond its
      borders. Zaporizhzhya and Kherson: The front line will be frozen and the current
      control of the territory will be recognised. Withdrawal of Russian troops: Under
      the proposal, Russia must leave all other occupied territories outside the five
      named regions (e.g. Sumy, Kharkiv or Dnipropetrovsk oblasts). NATO: the US declares
      that the alliance will not expand further and will not accept Ukraine. No NATO
      troops would be allowed to be deployed on Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian army:
      Authorized post-war size is limited to 800,000 troops. Security: Ukraine would
      receive guarantees similar to NATO Article 5, but without any legal force. Elections:
      must be held as soon as possible after the signing of the agreement. Zaporizhzhya
      nuclear power plant: It will be put back into operation under US supervision;
      Ukraine will get 50% of the energy produced. EU: The plan envisages Ukraine
      joining the European Union on 1 January 2027. Russian assets: The US intends
      to partially release Russian assets. Part of the funds would be used for the
      reconstruction of Ukraine, while another part could be directed to joint US-Russia

    detail: '- According to the Wall Street Journal, the United States has made proposals
      to Europe on how Russia could be reintegrated into the global economy. The US
      plan envisages US investment in key Russian industries such as precious metals
      and even envisages helping to restore Russian energy exports to Europe and the
      rest of the world, in stark contrast to the European strategy of cutting Russia
      off from gas supplies. The proposal also outlines how US financial institutions
      and companies could get involved in projects in Ukraine using some USD 200 billion
      of frozen Russian assets. U.S. actions have caused considerable tension in negotiations
      with European allies, who differ sharply in their ideas about Ukraine''s reconstruction
      and the conditions for future normalization of relations with Russia.

      - The UN General Assembly supported a Ukrainian resolution aimed at strengthening
      international cooperation and minimising the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.
      The document received the support of 97 states. Voting against were Russia,
      Belarus, China, North Korea, Nicaragua, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
      Niger and, unfortunately, the USA.

      - For the first time, Ukrainian forces used remote sensing drones to hit Lukoil''s
      Filanovsky oil platforms, located more than 905 km from the front line in the
      Caspian Sea. They were hit by more than four projectiles, resulting in the shutdown
      of oil and gas production from more than 20 wells.

      - Tucker Carlson said Russia would be the best ally for the United States "because
      it''s the largest territory in the world, with a lot of oil, gas, minerals,
      gold and everything else. From an America First policy perspective, it''s an
      ideal ally."

      - The British soldier who died in Ukraine a few days ago was Corporal George
      Hooley, 28, who was serving in a parachute regiment. He was killed while testing
      an interception drone. Two Ukrainians also died in the accident.

      - Ukrainian drones hit the Akron chemical plant in Veliky Novgorod, Russia,
      a major industrial complex located about 200 km from the Estonian border and
      700 km from Ukraine.

      - In occupied Donetsk, near school 115, a bust of Lance Corporal Michael Gloss,
      the son of the CIA deputy director who died fighting on the Russian side, was
      installed.

      - According to Politico, the United States is considering the creation of a
      new "Core 5" group consisting of the US, China, Russia, India and Japan as an
      alternative to the G7.

      - Since this year, every Finnish soldier has been learning to pilot drones,
      drop bombs, shoot down drones and perform maintenance on them.

      - Kazakhstan supplied oil from the Kashagan field to China for the first time
      after Ukrainian strikes crippled the Russian CPC terminal.

      - The United States seized a tanker carrying a cargo of oil from Venezuela to
      Cuba.

      - Military police intervene at a drone collection - Project Nemesis.

      - Zelensky responded to Trump''s blathering about the need for elections in
      Ukraine: he called on the US and Europe to ensure the security of the vote.
      If that happens, he said, Ukraine will be able to hold elections within 60 days.
      Russian officials immediately called that bluff.

      - Republican Thomas Massie introduced a bill in the US Congress to withdraw
      the US from NATO, calling the alliance a "relic of the Cold War" and arguing
      that the funds saved should be spent on US homeland security.

      - Mass seizures of property in occupied territories are now officially legal.
      Occupation authorities have been given the power to declare houses "ownerless"

      - According to Ukrainian intelligence, there is a risk of Russian sabotage and
      reconnaissance groups infiltrating the Odessa and Vinnytsia regions. Intensive
      mobilisation is underway in Transnistria, and mass production of drones and
      training of their operators has started.

      - A video has appeared on Russian social media showing the new commander of
      PMC Wagner''s private army, Dmitry Podolsky, known as "Salem". He lost both

    desc: 'In Russian propaganda, it is regularly claimed that the Russian advance
      is what it is (slow) because the Russian army is extremely considerate of the
      civilian population of Ukraine. What does the Russian "liberation" really look
      like? I guess it looks like this: As soon as any city is within range for Russian
      artillery, the systematic terrorization of the civilian population begins. The
      targets are shops, power stations, waterworks, schools, transport infrastructure...
      in short, everything that the civilian population needs to live a normal life.
      The goal is to make normal life in the city simply unsustainable, so that the
      civilian population will leave as soon as possible and Russia can accelerate
      the devastation of the city, which is now left with practically a fraction of
      people with nowhere to go, soldiers, and collaborators who help to direct the
      attacks on the two previously mentioned groups of people. This goes on for weeks,
      months, sometimes years. By the time the tanks and infantry approach the city,
      it is just an empty ruin. Then Russia literally blows all the remaining, still
      standing buildings to s**t. This is usually the point at which the Ukrainian
      army retreats, leaving only paratroopers, special forces and saboteurs to operate
      in the rubble. For the next few months, the Russians conquer the smoking ruins
      at the cost of tens to hundreds (in the case of villages) or thousands to tens
      of thousands (in the case of district towns) of lives, and when there are no
      Ukrainian soldiers left in the town, the Russians declare the town "liberated"
      and take the surviving collaborators to some godforsaken village outside the
      Urals. Then Ukrainian artillery starts leveling the remaining piles of bricks
      and panels, and after a short pause the whole situation repeats itself a few
      kilometres away. The Russians do not even respect the lives of their own soldiers,
      let alone foreign civilians. Then, when the Ukrainian army is far enough away,
      the "reconstruction of the liberated city" begins. This looks like a Chinese
      company moving in on a designated site, building prefabricated boxes instead
      of the original tenements and apartment blocks, moving in a few poor people
      who have believed the domestic propaganda about fabulous real estate at fabulous
      prices, Russian state television coming in to film a glorified report, and the
      new tenants being left to their fate in crumbling apartments without electricity
      or water. The thoughtfulness of it all is oozing out. But there is also [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0qsnqyizr698FAiKU4EBmtoe4bZ4o7i7xZDTZuxBXzdrNsBWi6C3V3eq4H3LMEEtnl):

      \ him, Witkoff and Kushner. But yesterday Zelensky let it be known that the\

      \ story printed by the satirical Croatian media outlet Newsbar. According to\
      \ the article, a virtual minister named Diella was removed from her post for\
      \ accepting a bribe of 14 bitcoins during a selection process. Volodin did not\
      \ understand that this was a humorous story.\n- When asked by reporters, Trump\
      \ said that \"Russia now has a stronger negotiating position because it's bigger.\"\
      \ He said Zelensky should start accepting offers of reconciliation because he\
      \ is losing on the battlefield. For context, it is worth recalling that according\
      \ to the still valid Budapest Memorandum, the United States (but also Russia)\
      \ is the guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n- The International\
      \ Court of Justice in The Hague has formally accepted Russian charges against\
      \ Ukraine for alleged genocide in the Donbas. Thus, Ukraine must submit a response\
      \ to Russia's allegations by December 7, 2026. Russia must submit its charges\
      \ by December 7, 2027.\n- Trump said that \"it has always been the general consensus,\
      \ even long before Putin, that Ukraine would not be admitted to NATO.\" If he\
      \ wasn't lying, he was inadvertently confirming that Russian propaganda about\
      \ the need to invade Ukraine to expand NATO is being sucked out of thin air.\n\
      - The four men accused of murdering Russell Bentley, an American communist and\
      \ propagandist who fought in the Donbas since 2014 on the side of pro-Russian\
      \ militants, were sentenced to prison terms of up to 12 years.\n- Russian domestic\
      \ propaganda continues to prepare the Russian population for a larger war with\
      \ Europe that could come within months or years of Trump forcing Ukraine to\
      \ capitulate.\n- A Russian An-22 military transport plane crashed in the Ivanovo\
      \ region. Seven people were on board, their fate is still unknown, but it is\
      \ believed that they did not survive the crash.\n- Honduras has issued an international\

      war against the whole of Europe. Sergei Karaganov, chairman of the Russian Council
      on Foreign and Defence Policy, said on television that the current war will
      not end until Russia "morally and politically" crushes Europe, because, he said,
      the current European elites are "pushing the world towards a global war". Europe,
      he said, will disintegrate and become "a junkyard of nations at war with each
      other" because it is a source of "evil for all humanity". European propaganda,
      he said, has created an indoctrinated population worse than that of Germany
      at the end of the Second World War. Karaganov therefore hopes that "Europeans
      will come to their senses before Russia has to resort to mass retaliation".

      Donbass. But he insists that peace talks should be derived from the current
      front, not from Russian demands. Indeed, to give up the Donbas would mean ceding
      to Russia a multi-layered defence and a belt of fortress cities built up over
      many years and at the cost of unimaginable losses. Ceding them would also allow
      Russia to use them as footholds for an invasion of the rest of Ukraine.

      - Russia ranks 28th out of 36 in the latest Global AI Ecosystem Development
      Index. Even the best Russian models lag behind older versions of ChatGPT and
      Gemini. While Putin recently identified AI development as a strategic priority,
      thousands of IT talents have left Russia for the West due to emerging totalitarianism
      and war. So now there is no intelligence in Russia. Neither real nor artificial.

      - The European Commission is proposing to distribute financial guarantees among
      EU member states to provide Ukraine with a "reparation loan" financed by frozen
      Russian assets. These guarantees are necessary to persuade Belgium to confiscate
      the 185 billion euros deposited in Euroclear. A further €25 billion is scattered
      across the Union in private bank accounts.

      - Zelensky held talks with European leaders in Britain. The British Prime Minister
      began his address to him by saying "We stand with Ukraine" and stressed that
      any potential ceasefire must be fair and lasting and that decisions on Ukraine
      must be made primarily by Ukraine.

      - Trump let it be known that he was disappointed by the lack of any response
      from Zelensky to Trump''s peace plan. According to Trump, Russia is ready to
      make a deal and Zelensky''s team is said to be excited about it. So sure...

      - According to Zelensky, "overtly un-Ukrainian" proposals were removed from
      the peace plan after the first rounds of negotiations. The draft subsequently
      presented by Witkoff in Moscow was therefore cut from 28 to 20 points.

      - On one of the Russian bombers parked in the hangar, the ejection system suddenly
      activated, with the crew already inside at the time. As a result, the pilot
      and navigator were killed.

      - According to the Ukrainian ombudsman, the Kremlin is preparing a new hybrid
      attack: staged "anti-war" demonstrations across Ukraine, for which it is recruiting
      mothers of fallen soldiers.

      - Russia has charged Robert "Hungarian" Brovdi in absentia for organizing an
      alleged terrorist attack in Russia''s Kursk region and issued an international
      arrest warrant for him.

      - Cambodia and Thailand - the same countries Trump previously claimed he helped
