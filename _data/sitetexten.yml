    desc: 'The overnight Russian attack on Kiev, which lasted an incredible 10 hours,
      killed 1 person and injured 28. Russia sent a total of 519 drones in several
      waves, as well as 40 missiles and cruise missiles. Some of the projectiles landed
      on high-rise apartment buildings, a tram depot, commercial buildings or a public
      transport stop. Of course, the power system was also hit. One of the buildings
      hit that could be said to be a potential military target was the dormitories
      belonging to the Kiev National Aviation University. However, they were empty
      at the time of the attack. All this is happening at a time when Trump is due
      to meet President Zelensky in person in the United States in just a few hours.
      According to Zelensky, this time the meeting will be public and journalists
      and their cameras will be present at all times. In any case, Putin has sent
      a clear signal about what he thinks about the peace talks. A signal in the form
      of more than 550 projectiles. And this is also happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02Na9LuG3EX8VXHKgiNBZsrfHS1zSiDKcjWtmfEdZUQ8catzfXMLB2pzPQ3C9MGgE4l):

      '
    detail: '- Belarus is assisting the Russians in carrying out airstrikes in Ukraine.
      Near the border with Ukraine, Russian soldiers are installing antennas and other
      equipment directly on the roofs of apartment buildings - all to accurately guide
      attack drones towards Ukraine''s western regions. Moreover, in recent airstrikes,
      some drones have flown into Ukrainian territory from Belarus in order to evade
      Ukrainian air defences.

      - Azerbaijan has strongly criticised Russia''s decision to end the prosecution
      in the case of the 2024 AZAL plane crash, with Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bajramov
      saying that such a move raises serious doubts. Especially given that Moscow
      had earlier admitted that the plane was hit by its anti-aircraft system. Baku
      insists that Russia fulfil all its obligations and investigate the incident
      properly.

      - Russian security forces stormed a rally of the religious movement "School
      of United Principle" in St Petersburg and detained about 70 people. The participants
      are now being investigated under an article of the Criminal Code on the dissemination
      of "false information" about the Russian army. According to RIA Novosti, the
      group reportedly held discussions about the war in Ukraine and prayers for President
      Zelensky''s health.

      - Russia has provided Ukraine with details of the 52 abducted residents of the
      village of Hrabovske in the Kharkiv region; there are no children among them.
      The Russians have also provided a video in which the abductees claim that they
      are being treated well and that they have been provided with the necessary medicine
      and food. Russia probably wants to use the abductees to further blackmail Ukraine.

      - Russia is attempting to restart its offensive in the immediate vicinity of
      Kupyansk after the failed attack on the city. Russian forces are currently regrouping
      on the left bank of the Oskil River, hoping to compensate for the previous failure
      with new actions.

      - The EU has just blacklisted a further 41 ships of the Russian shadow fleet,
      bringing the total number of vessels banned from European ports and access to
      insurance and services to more than 600.

      - Despite the war, Ukrainian farmers have harvested 23.5 million tonnes of maize
      this year, more than 40% of the EU''s total, and 9 million tonnes of sunflowers,
      surpassing the production of the entire European Union.

      - On the Zaporizhzhya front, Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) commander Denis "WhiteRex"
      Kapustin was killed by an FPV drone tonight.

      - In Bila Tserkva, a Russian kamikaze Geran drone hit a public transport bus
      stop.

      - Lithuania officially withdrew from the Ottawa Convention banning the use of
      anti-personnel mines.

      - Trump declared that "Zelensky has nothing until he approves it".

      - Ukraine has aligned new sanctions against Russia with the UK.

    desc: 'Turkey shot down a Russian reconnaissance drone with a Sidewinder missile
      from an F-16 aircraft after three separate violations of Turkish airspace in
      a matter of days: the first Orlan-10 drone crashed just 50 km from Istanbul;
      the wreckage of the second Merlin reconnaissance drone was found in western
      Turkey, where defence industry factories are located. According to Turkey, there
      is a pattern here that suggests deliberate surveillance, and it is not a navigational
      error as Russia claims. According to local media, Turkey is also seriously considering
      closing the canals linking the Mediterranean and Black Seas completely to all
      Russian vessels - not just military ones - if Russian provocations continue.
      Such a move would fundamentally cripple Russian exports by sea, as it would
      refer Russia to sea routes via the North Sea or, conversely, eastwards towards
      Alaska. However, it can be assumed that this will not happen and that it is
      merely a show of force on Turkey''s part. But the deterrent effect should be
      more than sufficient. And that''s what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid025T6YBvxMBDUxmvFRdE6bULq6LqTQGoML7gSfr3sowe6Bjrpf9Tszp9gyQfTuJaRxl):

      '
    detail: '- An Indian citizen who came to Russia on a student visa died in the
      war with Ukraine. Twenty-two-year-old Adjaya Godara came to Russia in November
      2024 to take language courses while looking for extra income. A few months later,
      he was conscripted into the army and sent to the front without any military
      training. He had previously told his family that he had been deceived and essentially
      forced into military service.

      - The Russians entered the town of Hulyaipole in the Zaporozhye part of the
      front. Russian soldiers posted a video showing them at the command post of the
      1st Battalion of the Ukrainian 106th Territorial Defence Brigade in the very
      centre of the town. From the video, the Ukrainian soldiers appear to have left
      the command post in a hurry, leaving behind their computers and phones.

      - The SBU detained a hitman in Kiev who tried to kill a Ukrainian GUR officer.
      The detainee is a 28-year-old citizen of a Central Asian country who was hired
      by the Russian FSB via Telegram. He was promised $50,000 and legal residency
      in the EU for the murder. He faces life imprisonment.

      - Solovyov received the award "For Merit for the Fatherland" of the third degree
      in the Kremlin. In a subsequent thank-you speech, he said that "the war gave
      his generation back its meaning". According to Solovyov, the Russians "stand
      against absolute evil, so their victory is inevitable" and "because they are
      Russians, God is with them."

      - The Russian Foreign Ministry urged its citizens not to travel to Germany.
      The reason given was that ''persecution of compatriots'' was taking place in
      Germany, and to give the message the right weight, the ministry attached a photograph
      of the bombed-out Reichstag to the appeal.

      - Germany''s Federal Minister for Digital Affairs, Carsten Wildberger, is working
      with a group of experts to introduce age limits on the use of social media -
      from Facebook and Instagram to TikTok.

      - On 24 December, explosions were reported at a Russian military base in Ussuriysk,
      near the border with North Korea and China. Two explosions hit the parking lot
      of the 80th Brigade of the Red Battalion of Vitebsk.

      - The Russian daily Kommersant claimed that the US was negotiating with Russia
      to use the occupied Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant for cryptocurrency mining
      and joint control without Ukraine''s participation.

      - The Ukrainian army launched a counterattack north of Pokrovsk and retook Suchetske,
      Suvorove and the Krasnolymanskaya mine north of Rodynske.

      - Russia sentenced a tortured journalist from Melitopol to 15 years in prison
      for supporting Ukraine on Telegram.

      - In Kazakhstan, more than 700 trials of participants in the war against Ukraine
      were opened in one year.

      - President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with US President Donald Trump on 28
      December.

      - In six districts of Russia''s Yakutia, the coal reserves of the local heating
      plants have almost run out.

      - Putin said Russians would welcome a tax increase if the money was used for
      the war.

      - Dozens of objects from Belarus reportedly infiltrated Poland during the overnight
      raid.

      - Russia conducted a night raid on the Kovel railway station on the line to
      Lviv.

    desc: 'The United States declassified a series of documents showing, among other
      things, conversations between Putin and then US President Bush. They show that
      as early as 2001, and then again in 2008, Putin referred to Ukraine as ''an
      artificial state that did not arise naturally but from pieces of territory from
      former Soviet republics such as Poland, Romania and Hungary'' and ''partly as
      a gift from Russia''. Putin also threatened Bush at the time that if Ukraine
      were admitted to NATO, it would lead to a long conflict between Russia and the
      United States. He also lied to him that most Ukrainians view NATO as a hostile
      organization, and threatened that Russia would take steps to prevent the Alliance
      from growing any further. The comparison with Putin''s public statements is
      also interesting. Indeed, as recently as 2005, he publicly stated that Ukraine''s
      possible entry into NATO would pose no threat to Russia, and that Russia would
      not in any way prevent the former Soviet republics from applying for membership,
      but would instead respect their sovereign choice. Putin''s imperial ambitions
      and the rhetoric associated with them therefore have a history of at least 25
      years. They did not originate in 2013, 2014 or 2022. They are positions that
      Putin has clearly held for at least a quarter of a century in diplomatic contact
      and privately... probably forever. It''s never been about NATO. It has always
      been about Russia''s desire to subjugate and control Ukraine. And now for more
      [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0orwox3WDChhAJb7Uer6588ghXTk3mdPQXmWDQ3nRksYLdfZB4TzDAJHY5gTGWC84l):

      '
    detail: '- Today, 25 December, the Ukrainian Air Force conducted a successful
      airstrike using Storm Shadow cruise missiles on the Novosakhtinsk oil refinery
      in the Rostov Region of Russia. Several explosions were reported at the refinery
      site. The Novosakhtinsk refinery is one of the largest suppliers of petroleum
      products in southern Russia and is directly involved in supplying the armed
      forces. It is also probably the first time that British missiles have been used
      to hit Russian energy infrastructure.

      - Russian authorities say Ukrainian drones hit a convoy in the Belgorod region
      near the town of Grushevka, killing the deputy regional governor from Dagestan,
      Magomednabi Gadzhiev, and two others, and wounding a fourth person. Moscow says
      it was a "humanitarian" convoy "carrying food, tools and letters for Russian
      soldiers".

      - Russian bloggers with links to the Russian military are increasingly speaking
      out about the fact that the Russian military command is probably lying to political
      leaders about its successes on the front, resulting in medals being handed out
      for capturing towns that the Russian army has not even entered yet or has already
      been pushed back.

      - The New York Times reports that despite the colossal losses to the Russian
      economy and military, the Kremlin still considers war preferable to peace and
      is convinced that continuing the war will bring better results for Russia than
      any peace talks.

      - On the night of 25-26 December, drones of the Special Operations Center "Alpha"
      of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) attacked the port of Temryuk in Russia''s
      Krasnodar Krai, as well as a gas processing plant in the Orenburg region.

      - Kim Jong-un unveiled the first nuclear submarine in North Korean history.
      It is comparable in size to US submarines. But experts doubt the authenticity
      of the vessel unveiled.

      - Russian military bloggers finally admit that Kupyansk is back under the control
      of Ukrainian forces. Moreover, the Ukrainian army is making forays further northeast
      to push the Russian army away from the city.

      - According to Bloomberg, Reliance Industries, a leading Indian refiner, has
      resumed importing Russian crude after halting purchases in October due to US
      sanctions. Trump''s sanctions are simply not being taken seriously.

      - NATO sent its fighter jets into the air opposite a group of Russian Tu-95MS
      strategic bombers heading across the North Sea towards the northern part of
      the UK on Christmas Day.

      - "Degenerate Europe" is still the most popular country for property purchases
      by Russians. On average, 49% of all Russian property purchases are made in an
      EU country.

      - In 14 days, Russia''s "three-day special military operation" will last as
      long as the entire Eastern Front of World War II.

      - The leader of the neo-Nazi formation of the DSSRG, Russian Alexei Milchakov,
      led a class called "Test of Courage" at a school in St. Petersburg.

      - Russian officials say 16 drones targeting Moscow were shot down on Christmas
      Eve.

      - Moscow''s mayor says the city is short about 400-500 thousand workers.

      - Ukrainians have pushed Russians out of five villages on the border of the
      Dnipropetrovsk region.

      - Poland shot down a Russian Orlan-10 drone over the Baltic Sea.

    desc: 'Christmas Eve. Today''s report comes out at the end of the day on purpose,
      so that you can take the opportunity to not read it at least one day a year.
      For I have recently realized that it is not only important to have enough good
      information to make informed decisions. It''s just as important to maintain
      your mental well-being. This is so that we can more easily tolerate information
      - especially the gloomy kind - without letting our hardships turn us into cynics
      and without allowing Russian propaganda to make us eventually resign ourselves
      to overwhelm. Therefore, I wish you a happy Christmas in the circle of those
      closest to you. Recharge your batteries, recharge your positive emotions, and
      enjoy to the full the peace and tranquillity that we do have in the Czech Republic
      - unlike most of the world. In the New Year, every extra energy will be needed.

      are involved in "censoring American citizens" (in effect, fining Elon Musk).
      Among those on the sanctions list are Thierry Breton, author of the Digital
      Services Act, Imran Ahmed of the Center for Combating Hate in the Digital Space,
      Clare Melford of the Global Misinformation Index, Anna-Lena von Hodenberg of
      HateAid, and her colleague Josephine Ballon.

      - SBU military counterintelligence drones hit and destroyed a Russian Il-38N
      maritime reconnaissance aircraft at the Yeysk airbase just before the recent
      attack that damaged a Russian Kilo-class submarine. It is the Il-38N that is
      capable of detecting a variety of vessels, including maritime drones.

      - An unidentified man threw an explosive through the window of a police vehicle
      in Moscow. Two policemen were killed on the spot, two others are in critical
      condition and the attacker also died. The Russians killed had fought in Ukraine
      in recent years and there is evidence that they were involved in the torture
      of Ukrainian prisoners of war.

      - Russia has rejected the US-Ukraine 20-point peace plan and is already preparing
      counterproposals. President Zelensky, on the other hand, has said that Ukraine
      could hold a national referendum on the 20-point peace plan if Russia guarantees
      at least a 60-day ceasefire.

      "that "HE" dies". He meant, of course, Putin.

      - Ukrainian intelligence has revealed a link between Chinese satellite imagery
      of Ukraine and Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities.

      - Russia hit a Turkish cargo ship en route from Odessa across the Black Sea.
      This is the fourth Turkish-flagged ship to be hit.

      - The Estonian Ministry of Climate Affairs announced that Ukraine will receive
      €2 million from Estonia to restore its energy infrastructure.

      - According to the Minister of Defence, Ukraine is on track to receive a total
      of 3 million FPV drones in 2026.

      - The Ukrainian army announced that it has withdrawn from Siversk. The town
      is now under Russian control.

      - A Ukrainian man who carried out espionage on behalf of Belarus was sentenced
      in court to 15 years in prison.

    desc: 'After the new defence minister nominated by the SPD, Jaromír Zůna, declared
      at a press conference that Russia is the aggressor and that the Czech munitions
      initiative will continue, the SPD has been showing us for days what their "freedom"
      and "democracy" mean. Okamura''s fascist party first tried to "set the record
      straight" with Zůna''s statements, then deleted Zůna''s social media accounts,
      and then videos of Zůna and SPD member Radim Fiala surfaced, with Fiala literally
      telling Zůna what views and positions to take. The SPD also announced as a precautionary
      measure that Zůna would only comment on military matters and that he would leave
      foreign policy to Prime Minister Babiš. Meanwhile, the SPD''s coalition partner,
      the Motorists, have begun purging the Foreign Ministry through Macinka and firing
      long-time career diplomats. And this is what''s happening too [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0pBwrpNGbP5FpHbkpu851JUPzGkHcrwHXhHRtnZYbXvKZScQGc2VUA8JJSTFHNQbwl):

      '
    detail: '- The Washington Post reports that the Russian economy is in danger.
      Russia''s reserves are depleted, sanctions are hitting oil and banks hard, and
      2026 could bring a financial crisis. The Kremlin has spent most of the cash
      reserves and borrowed money that allowed it to finance record military spending.
      But because of the sanctions, Moscow is forced to sell oil at a discount of
      more than $20 a barrel, and oil and gas revenues, which are crucial to the Russian
      budget, are falling. At the same time, military spending has reached a record
      $149 billion this year. Russian bankers themselves are sounding the alarm about
      the rising level of non-performing loans in the banking system. High interest
      rates, which have now fallen to 16%, may be taming high inflation slightly,
      but they are contributing to a parallel reduction in corporate profits and cash
      reserves. As a result, investment has stalled, production in some sectors has
      fallen sharply and insolvencies have increased throughout the economy.

      - Russia has sent 635 drones and 38 missiles/shots to Ukraine. At least 13 regions
      were hit and at least four people were killed, including a four-year-old child.
      In Kiev, the alert over the air strike lasted for almost four and a half hours
      and it was only over the morning that it was announced that the danger had passed.
      In the Svyatoshynskyi district of Kiev, a drone hit a high-rise apartment building.
      In the Kiev region, the debris of a drone landed on a residential building and
      destroyed it. The greatest damage was caused to the energy infrastructure in
      the west of Ukraine. As a result, most of Ukraine is experiencing emergency
      power cuts and the Rivne region is almost entirely without electricity.

      - Russia is refusing to leave the consulate in Gdansk, which must be closed
      by midnight on the 23rd, following a decision by the Ministry of the Interior.
      If it goes to court, the eviction of the Russians could take years. Meanwhile,
      Moscow has not paid a single penny for the building since 2013, bringing the
      debt for unpaid fees and interest to nearly €2 million. The court has already
      ordered Russia to pay about €80,000 in interest on the late fees. But Russia
      ignored it. It is strikingly reminiscent of the situation in Prague.

      - Russian state propaganda has produced a new video in which actors playing
      Europeans at Christmas dinner blame everything bad that happens in their lives
      on Putin. For context, it should be added that ''Putin is to blame for everything''
      is not only the point of current Russian propaganda, but also a long-standing
      argument of the local fifth column, which has been consuming Russian propaganda
      for years.

      - The Venezuelan army has started handing out rifles to civilians in working-class
      neighbourhoods. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry has begun evacuating
      the families of diplomats from Venezuela. What are the chances that Trump traded
      the Russians'' departure from Venezuela for the US not intervening in Ukraine?

      - Babis announced that the Czech Security Council will decide on the future
      of the munitions initiative on January 7. In his words, it is a good thing,
      but it needs to be investigated to see if there was corruption involved.

      - According to the Financial Times, Putin has been receiving overly optimistic
      reports from the battlefield, leading him to believe that Russia is winning
      the war, when the reality is much more complicated.

      - The US is again increasing pressure on Greenland. Donald Trump''s special
      envoy for Greenland, Jeff Landry, has said that the island should become part
      of the United States.

      - The United States has banned all new foreign-made drones and related components
      on the grounds that they pose a risk of espionage and data leaks.

      - Without explanation, the United States has lifted sanctions on several companies
      previously accused of supporting the Russian military.

      - Over 1.19 million Russian soldiers have already died or suffered irreversible
      injuries in Ukraine, yet the Kremlin has not yet captured a single major city.

      - According to a recent Pentagon preliminary report, China expects to be able
      to wage and win a war over Taiwan by the end of 2027.

      - Finnish President Alexander Stubb signed a law raising the age for enlistment
      from 50 to 65 for all eligible draftees.

      - About 100 Russian soldiers remain in Kupjansk with almost no ammunition and
      no supplies reaching them.

      - Putin recalled Ambassador Alexander Zmeyevsky and replaced him with Anna Ponomareva.

      - Aidar officially announced that he was expanding to a regiment.

      to build an ammunition plant and create a complete production cycle for 122mm
      and 152mm artillery and rocket ammunition for the Russian army in Ukraine. Thus,
      Belarus continues to play the role of Russia''s forward base as well as its
      "bank", willingly providing whatever Putin asks for. That is why the steps taken
      by the current US administration to loosen some of the sanctions against Belarus

      to EU and US sanctions and is accused of transporting weapons used in the war
      against Ukraine. The ship was detained in Swedish territorial waters for not
      having a mandatory customs declaration. However, it was later released again
      by the Swedish coastguard without any charges being brought.

      - The head of the Russian Armed Forces'' Operational Training Department, Lieutenant
      General Sarvarov, was killed in a car explosion in Moscow. The explosion occurred
      when Sarvarov slammed on the brakes. As a result of the explosion, he suffered
      severe multiple injuries to his lower limbs from shrapnel and later died in
      hospital.

      - Video from the Ukrainian 92nd Brigade shows two Russian soldiers moving into
      position on horseback. One of them was probably killed by an FPV drone along
      with the animal, the other was thrown by the horse and escaped.

      - The head of a Ukrainian arms company, Anatoly Khrapchynsky, warned that Russia
      was producing about 20% more weapons, equipment and ammunition than it needed
      for the war with Ukraine. He says he is stockpiling supplies for potential operations
      in Europe.

      - The Serbian news server "Danas", citing Russian sources, reports that Serbian
      and Armenian banks have begun blocking financial transactions and even the bank
      accounts of Russian citizens living in the two countries.

      - Lithuania has supplied Ukraine with a thermal power plant. The operation lasted
      11 months and included 149 deliveries of technical equipment to enable emergency
      repairs to Ukraine''s energy infrastructure.

      - Intelligence services in NATO countries suspect Russia of working on a weapon
      that could disable entire constellations of satellites at once using clouds

      existing Polish route via Rzeszów.

      - A working group is being set up in the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada to urgently
      address the issue of holding possible presidential elections under martial law.

      - Russian troops crossed the border in the Sumy region, entered the border village
      of Hraboske and took about fifty local residents back to Russia.

      - Ukrainian drones hit the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal in the village of Volna
      in the Krasnodar region. Two Russian oil tankers were also hit in the attack.

    desc: 'The Wall Street Journal claims that Putin himself chose Witkoff as his
      chief negotiator with the US. The Russian-US talks began after the Saudi prince
      gave Witkoff a message from the Kremlin: Putin is interested in meeting with
      him. But the Kremlin had a condition at the time: Witkoff must come alone, without
      CIA agents, diplomats, or even his own translator. During the first meeting,
      Putin was then to offer Witkoff the release of American Mark Fogel, sentenced
      in Russia to several years in prison for possession of a small amount of cannabis
      (Fogel was presumably detained precisely to serve as a hostage, and was indeed
      released after the negotiations). That Putin chose Witkoff in particular was
      no accident: Putin had studied psychological profiles of people in Trump''s
      inner circle, including the special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, but whom
      the Russian dictator considered too pro-Ukrainian. With Witkoff, he was clearly
      on target. Anyway, other [things] happened too(https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0TL1LRJeCTRDaeTQ4MwtAYvFXmH8bjKMqZmFC8i96XAKKHfZ5Gh3oyHVN5ruFH4PQl):

    detail: '- According to DeepState, the Russians again attempted to use the pipeline
      for infiltration and suffered heavy losses in the process. The attack took place
      on December 16 north of Novoplatonivka. Russian troops attempted to move through
      the pipeline leading from Svatovo to the Oskil River. However, the 77th Independent
      Air Brigade noticed that groups of Russians were coming out of the pipeline
      at several points and attacked them with bombing drones. As a result, 40 Russian
      soldiers were destroyed in their sector and all losses were documented on video.

      - A central gas pipeline in Russia''s Volgograd region was taken out of service
      on Thursday, indefinitely disrupting a route Russia uses to import up to 12
      billion cubic meters of gas a year from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Ukrainian
      military intelligence suggests that this is a consequence of its actions.

      - Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of the Ukrainian armed forces, was awarded
      France''s highest state decoration, the Legion of Honour, which is bestowed

      - Ukraine''s Foreign Ministry is working to create a mechanism to allow Ukrainian
      citizens living abroad to vote in the next Ukrainian elections.

      for several minutes yesterday before security forces shot it down using electronic
      warfare systems.

      - Russia is turning the occupied Donbas into a base for recruiting soldiers
      and using financial debts to force Ukrainians into contracts with the military.

      - Kremlin official Kirill Dmitriev said after a meeting in the United States
      that Russia is preparing to cooperate with the United States in the Arctic.

      - Portugal will contribute $52 million to the PURL mechanism, which allows Ukraine
      to buy weapons from the United States.

      - Ukraine replaces the commanding officer of the Southern Air Force Command
      after repeated deadly Russian airstrikes in the Odessa region.

      - According to Ukrainian war veteran Mykola Melnyk, the battle for Slovyansk

    desc: 'Putin has openly declared that the goal of the Russian invasion of Ukraine
      is to "liberate Russia''s historical territories". In doing so, he has de facto
      confirmed that all previous "reasons", such as the expansion of NATO, the alleged
      fascists in charge of Ukraine, or the alleged oppression of the Russian-speaking
      minority, are just lying propaganda to cover up the real reason for Russian
      aggression: imperialism. The smarter ones have known this for the last thirty
      years. Perhaps Putin''s admission will finally open the eyes of some. But the
      members of Russia''s fifth column will continue to parrot every lie that portrays
      Russia as a victim so that they don''t have to admit that they are nasty people
      cheering on a nasty regime. And that''s what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02CVEe2fpkmSJrETF7iY8ZXjdywcjLWaozy8uyD73ut8VqTXsyShArvRgr9iSJTQnl):

    title: Friday
    detail: "- The following information appeared on Ukrainian and many Russian channels:\
      \ the Ukrainian army hit a tanker belonging to the Russian shadow fleet in the\
      \ Mediterranean Sea. However, the oil on board was allegedly not oil, but persons\
      \ with links to the Russian government and members of the military intelligence\
      \ (GRU) responsible for drone spying across Europe, sabotage and other subversive\
      \ actions. Seven people were reportedly injured and two killed in the attack.\
      \ One of the two dead is believed to be Andrei Vladimirovich Averyanov, at the\
      \ time a GRU Major General. Averjanov was responsible for GRU activities primarily\
      \ on EU territory, but not only there. On Putin's orders, he had carried out\
      \ a number of operations abroad in recent years. He was also supposed to have\
      \ been involved in the bombing of Prigozhin's plane or the Novichok poisoning\
      \ in Britain. But pending confirmation from official sources, the report should\
      \ be taken with a grain of salt.\n- According to the intelligence services and\
      \ militaries of several European countries, it is increasingly common for military\
      \ personnel or members of private armies, such as the Wagner family, to be present\
      \ on ships belonging to the Russian shadow fleet. In addition, it is reportedly\
      \ apparent that armed personnel are on board not only to defend the ship, but\
      \ in fact control the ship. Therefore, it is believed that the tankers both\
      \ serve a reconnaissance function and also serve as floating bases for subversive\
      \ actions. This correlates with the previous report.  \n- Russia lured two Colombians\
      \ to work as welders for $2,500 a month. But in Ufa, their passports were confiscated\
      \ and the pair were given rifles instead of welders. Three of the original seven\
      \ members of the hit squad they were assigned to are now dead. These two survived\
      \ and surrendered without firing a single shot.\n- Russia has been trying for\
      \ days to cut off the western part of the Odessa region from the rest of it.\
      \ Russian Geran drones have repeatedly attacked bridges there in large swarms.\
      \ On 18 December, one such drone hit a civilian car travelling on a bridge,\
      \ killing the woman driver and injuring her three children.\n- Ukrainian intelligence\
      \ has used drones to hit another Russian oil platform in the Caspian Sea. This\
      \ is the fourth attack and the third oil platform hit. The last attack was against\
      \ a platform in the Rakushchenskoye area, named after Valery Graifer.\n- Pavel\
      \ Gubarev, the former occupation chief of Donetsk, claims that Chechen Kadyrov's\
      \ forces from the Akhmat militia did not fight in the occupied territories of\
      \ Ukraine, but only looted.\n- The new SPD-nominated defence minister announced\
      \ that the munitions initiative for Ukraine would continue and praised the outgoing\
      \ government for its project to buy F-35 fighter jets.\n- The European Parliament\
      \ voted in favour of the creation of a \"military Schengen\", which will allow\
      \ troops to cross borders within 24 hours in the event of a crisis.\n- The US\
      \ Treasury lifted sanctions on entities that supply components and technology\
      \ to the Russian and Iranian military industries.\n- In Switzerland, a court\
      \ found guilty a citizen who had participated in the fighting as a volunteer\
      \ soldier in the ranks of Ukraine.  \n- Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia\
      \ will not join the EU-wide funding of Ukraine.\n- Russia has begun to claim\
      \ that \"Old Finland\" (Vanha Suomi) is territory that belongs to Russia.\n\
      - According to Putin, some 700,000 Russian troops are now fighting on Ukrainian\
      \ territory.\n- Putin said on television that Ukraine had started the war with\
      \ Russia.\n- Ukraine has repatriated the remains of another 1,000 fallen soldiers.\n\
      - The crew of a Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter was killed in combat.\n- A stray\
      \ Russian Orlan drone crashed into Turkish territory.\n"

    desc: 'Ukrainian drones hit the Russian military airport Belbek in occupied Crimea.
      The airstrike destroyed a Russian MiG-31 fighter-bomber, which was fully armed
      with missiles at the time of the attack. The Pantsir-S2 air defence system,
      which was supposed to protect the airport from the drones, was also destroyed,
      as was the 92N6 radar belonging to the S-400 system and two other Nebo-SVU radars.
      These attacks are important not only because they weaken the Russian army, but
      also because they weaken the Russian military industry. Russia profits from
      its massive arms exports, especially to Africa, Asia and some countries in South
      America. And if its clients see on the ground that the systems are not working
      as they should on paper, countries will start looking for other suppliers. However,
      this is also happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02LH1g3PLkmE74Rj7JLN6R3bdrv7PBdPxBunt8sBv8jm6WkDPkikKQU4C6WpSc4eHul).

    title: Thursday
    detail: '- The US announced a massive military package for Taiwan, the largest
      ever. The package, worth over $11 billion, is to include: The US Armed Forces
      Tactical Operations Network (TMN), 82 HIMARS missile systems, 420 ATACMS tactical
      missile systems, 120 M109A7 Paladin self-propelled howitzers, 1,545 TOW missiles,
      1,050 Javelin anti-tank missiles, parts for Harpoon anti-ship missiles, ALTIUS-600M
      and 700M drones, and spare parts for AH-1W SuperCobra attack helicopters.

      - On the Zaporizhzhya front, a cynical system of corruption operates within
      the Russian military. A group of soldiers pays their commander 50,000 rubles
      in cash every month to avoid the front. In return, they work in the army headquarters,
      where they are assigned fictitious "internal tasks" while official documents
      label them as combat mission participants in order to keep their higher pay
      and benefits.

      - On Wednesday morning, a trio of Russian border guards crossed the border with
      Estonia and were on Estonian territory for about 20 minutes. The Estonian authorities
      claim in official communications that this may have been a provocation, but
      it is equally possible that it was a mistake; however, given that it is impossible
      for the Russian border guards not to know which way the common border runs,
      it can be assumed that it was a provocation.

      - According to the Guardian, Russian military intelligence is conducting an
      intimidation campaign in which it is threatening Belgian officials. The aim
      is to prevent the transfer of frozen Russian currency reserves to Ukraine. At
      the same time, there are reports that the Americans are also discouraging European
      leaders from seizing Russian assets.

      - In a speech yesterday, Putin described European leaders as "underdogs". Today,
      Russian state propaganda ''explains'' that this is because they are the descendants
      of European Nazis with ''imperialist ambitions'' who are redrawing maps and
      dreaming of revenge for the Second World War. In short, classic Russian psychological
      projection.

      - The US Senate has approved a defence budget for fiscal year 2026 of more than
      900 billion dollars. The bill also includes $400 million for Ukraine as part
      of a programme to buy new weapons.

      - Erdoğan is offering Russia back its S-400 missile systems, reportedly unused
      as Turkey seeks to restore relations with the US and a potential purchase of
      F-35 fighter jets, which has been halted due to the acquisition of the air defense
      systems.

      - Trump justifies possible military intervention in Venezuela on the grounds
      that US companies until recently had licenses to extract Venezuelan oil, and
      that he thus wants to "take back what belongs to the United States".

      - According to Putin, "the objectives of the Special Military Operation must
      be fulfilled unconditionally". He also reiterated the need to occupy other Ukrainian
      territories and referred to Odessa as a "Russian city."

      - Tankers carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea have begun to take a detour
      along the coasts of Georgia and Turkey to reduce the risk of attacks by Ukrainian
      naval drones.

      - A fire broke out at the Ordzhonikidze plant in Saratov, Russia, a major industrial
      complex known for producing aerospace and defence equipment.

      - Britain is demanding that Abramovich hand over £2.5 billion from the sale
      of Chelsea to Ukraine. If he fails to do so, the funds will reportedly be obtained
      through the courts.

      - Russia sank several vessels at the entrance to the port of Novorossiysk, de
      facto barricading the Black Sea Fleet ships from the high seas.

      - According to TASS, Steve Witkoff handed Trump a crate of red caviar from Russia''s
      Khabarovsk region.

      - Ukraine hit an oil tanker in the port of Rostov, Russia, last night. Two crew
      members were killed and three others were injured.

      - The Russian army absorbed some territorial defence units in order to deploy
      them to the front.

      - Poland began production of anti-personnel mines for the first time since the
      end of the Cold War.

      - The EU approved a complete withdrawal from Russian gas by the end of 2027.

      - The Ukrainians regain control of about 90% of Kupyansk.

    desc: 'Russian forces attempted a blitzkrieg attack with a motorcycle and buggy
      convoy heading from the Pokrovsk region to the 3.5 km distant town of Hryshyn,
      believing that this would bypass the Ukrainian positions and cut off their supply
      routes. However, Ukrainian drones were constantly monitoring the area. Drone
      videos show that the entire convoy lay in ashes about a kilometre after take-off
      - several vehicles were hit simultaneously, suggesting that dozens of drones
      were waiting in advance in a convenient location for Russian vehicles to ambush.
      The final tally: 10 vehicles destroyed, around 40 soldiers killed. The surviving
      soldiers who tried to continue on foot somehow forgot to split up and were thus
      incapacitated after a few minutes by a single FPV drone. And that''s what''s

    title: Wednesday
    detail: '- Investigators have released details of the recent brutal murder of
      21-year-old Danylo Kuzmin, the son of the deputy mayor of Kharkiv, in Vienna.
      Kuzmin was lured into a trap in the underground garage of the luxury Sofitel
      hotel by his 19-year-old compatriot and his 45-year-old accomplice. In the garage,
      he was brutally beaten so badly that Kuzmin had almost no teeth left. During
      the torture, Kuzmin revealed the passwords to two crypto wallets containing
      $200,000 in cryptocurrency. The badly injured Kuzmin was then placed in the
      back seat of a Mercedes belonging to his father and taken to the Donaustadt
      district of Vienna, where the perpetrators set the car on fire with Kuzmin still
      alive inside. On the basis of footage from hotel cameras, the Viennese police
      quickly identified the suspects. The 45-year-old suspect is a former high-ranking
      official of the Odessa customs administration, while the 19-year-old is the
      son of a well-known businessman from Chernivtsi and the stepson of the Ukrainian
      ambassador to Bulgaria.

      - Overnight, Ukrainian forces carried out a series of airstrikes, hitting, for
      example, an oil refinery near Slavyansk-on-Kuban. The plant processes up to
      5.2 million tonnes of oil a year and directly supports the Russian army. Drones
      have also damaged high voltage power lines there. In addition, an attack on
      the Nikolayevskaya fuel depot in the Rostov region has been confirmed. Tanks
      as well as the river barge Kapitan Gibert were damaged. In the occupied Luhansk
      region, a field artillery ammunition depot belonging to one of the units was
      destroyed.

      - German Chancellor Merz says the security guarantees proposed by the United
      States would allow Western forces to "intervene against Russian incursions and
      attacks" in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine. In any case, Russia has announced
      in advance that it will not accept the presence of any Western troops in Ukraine.

      - German MP and military expert Kiesewetter clarified that yesterday''s information
      about 360,000 Russian troops on NATO''s borders should not be seen as an assessment
      of the real presence of Russian troops in Belarus, but that it was "based on
      a misinterpretation of broader estimates of the size of the army."

      - The US President has branded the Maduro regime a foreign terrorist organisation
      and announced a "complete and total blockade" of oil tankers sailing to and
      from Venezuela. Under international law, this is potentially an act of war,
      which requires congressional approval.

      - Nigel Farage''s biggest backer, who has just given £9 million in financial
      support to Reform UK, is financially linked to a platform that spreads Russian
      state propaganda and runs influence operations linked to Russian intelligence.

      - Russian Defence Minister Belousov: ''NATO began preparations for a conflict
      with Russia in the early 1930s. The policy of European countries and NATO creates
      real preconditions for the continuation of military actions in Ukraine in 2026."

      - Legal guarantees have not been enough to allay Belgium''s fears of Russian
      retaliation, and Italy, Malta, Bulgaria and now the Czech Republic are supporting
      Belgium''s call for alternative ways to finance Ukraine''s reconstruction.

      - The European Union has added Diana Panchenko, a Russian propagandist of Ukrainian
      origin, to the sanctions list. The one that Rajchl claimed was an "independent,
      award-winning journalist with whom he is in contact".

      - Washington is preparing a new package of sanctions, including measures targeting
      Russia''s energy sector, to increase pressure on Moscow if Putin rejects the
      proposed peace deal.

      - Boris Pistorius announced that Germany will extend military aid to Ukraine
      for 2026 by another 3 billion euros. This will bring the total aid to 11.5 billion
      euros, a new record.

      - Ukrainian troops continue to advance in and around Kupyansk in the Kharkiv
      region, where the Russians must now rely on drones to supply isolated troops.

      - Georgia''s parliament, controlled by the pro-Russian Georgian Sen party, has
      passed a law to abolish the anti-corruption office, which was set up on the
      recommendation of the EU.

      - 34 countries and the European Union signed a convention to establish a new
      compensation body, the International Commission on Compensation for Ukraine.

      - Slovakia granted asylum to Russian influence operation actor Artyom Marchevsky,
      despite a promise to the Czech BIS.

      SDPR in Russia, was assassinated in Moscow.

      - Ukrainian forces liquidated Mykhailo Mishyn, former "DNR Minister of Sport",
      near Pokrovsk.

      - Ukrainian drones hit and destroyed a column of Russian S-400 systems in Rajevka
      near Belgorod.

      - Putin signed a law allowing the seizure of real estate in occupied territories.

      - Russian propaganda is now spreading claims that Zelensky is the owner of an
      Israeli passport.

      - A Russian "guided" aerial bomb landed on a block of flats in Zaporozhye today.

      submarine 636 Varshavianka in Novorossiysk harbour. Official Russian military
      channels deny that the vessel suffered any damage, but Russian military bloggers
      say the pressure wave hit the submarine''s tail and damaged the stern fins and

      several pupils at a local school. Videos on the networks show that the attacker
      explicitly targeted immigrants. He was wearing a T-shirt with "No Lives Matter"
      written on it and before the attack he actively addressed the pupils and asked
      which of them was a foreigner. Police said the attacker was a supporter of neo-Nazi
      movements. This is the second attack on a Russian school in two days.

      - British Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, Chief of the General Staff, said
      the country must prepare for a possible war with Russia. He said the risk of

      but also to ordinary people - families and households. The situation, he said,
      is the most dangerous in his entire career in the army.

      - The Swedish Navy has announced that armed personnel in Russian military uniforms
      are on board tankers carrying Russian oil and subject to sanctions. According

    desc: 'Kiev and the whole of eastern Ukraine are just one step away from a widespread
      power outage, analysts say. At risk are key elements of the power grid that
      bring electricity from western Ukraine - where most of the production is now
      concentrated - to the east. According to the WP, the Kremlin is deliberately
      creating so-called "energy islands" to completely cut off entire regions from
      electricity production and a unified grid. This makes no military sense, of
      course. It is a deliberate terrorising of the civilian population, a psychological
      operation to force Ukraine to surrender through political pressure. And it is
      having an effect not only on the Ukrainian civilian population, but also on
      civilians in Western countries, where, in response, there is a growing sentiment
      of ''as long as the suffering stops, no matter how''. The Ukrainians themselves
      are much more resilient than some Westerners think. And a new opinion poll in
      Ukraine proves it. But I''d get ahead of myself, first this [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0X9bE5sXDEzqC43wCCL1MtdRMg65NWGUEcDhwcFHDVsw3Cwx4hxQCZBRdsJphz5pCl):

      '
    detail: '- According to AFP, the US delegation in Berlin is pressing Ukraine to
      surrender Donbas. The current proposal includes a "freeze" of the front, under
      which Ukraine would have to relinquish control of part of its territory. In
      Kiev, in any case, this proposal is not seen as a path to peace, but as a forced
      surrender.

      - Fascism in the world is on the rise. The ultra-conservative politician José
      Antonio Kast has been elected President of Chile. Kast is the son of a former
      Nazi Party member who moved to Chile after World War II and is an unapologetic
      admirer of dictator Augusto Pinochet.

      - Russia has begun recruiting mercenaries in Iran, offering a signing bonus
      of $20,000 and a monthly salary of $2,000 through Telegram. It is targeting
      economically vulnerable populations in a campaign that has already attracted
      18,000 foreigners from 128 countries.

      - According to the latest poll, 61% of Ukrainians support Zelensky as Ukraine''s
      leader. Fewer than a tenth of Ukrainians support holding elections during wartime.
      75% of Ukrainians oppose a "peace plan" if it includes territorial concessions.

      - German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told Die Welt that German authorities
      are investigating the recruitment of radical groups by foreign governments for
      sabotage and espionage.

      - Fugitive former Syrian President Bashar Assad has decided to start a new life
      in Russia - he has become an ophthalmologist and is treating Moscow''s elite.

      - The US envoy says Belarus will release another 1 000 political prisoners in

    desc: 'Austria has uncovered a conspiracy network organised by the Russian FSB
      posing as "Ukrainian Nazis". The network was coordinated by a native Austrian
      who has long worked for the Russian intelligence services. From 2022, he and
      a colleague - a Bulgarian citizen who was later arrested in London - organised
      the production and pasting of stickers and spray-painting of graffiti with far-right
      and neo-Nazi symbols in public places. All these actions were aimed at giving
      the impression that neo-Nazi symbols were being spread by Ukrainians. In addition,
      the two men, in cooperation with others, created a network of websites that
      mimicked the European branches of the Ukrainian Azov regiment. According to
      the investigation, the psychological operation did not only concern Austria,
      but also other European countries. In short, there are so many Nazis in Ukraine
      that Russian intelligence has to constantly invent them. And that''s what''s
      happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0UxuYbYPYVZ712tqkV8xgFxwvUiWWw8eCrFbdejL8Ty2RCcFZKiQFmcsAg8V7GukDl):

      tattoos.

      - Ukrainian media report that Siversk in the Donetsk region, which Russian troops
      have been actively attacking since the end of October under the cover of a thick
      fog, has been almost completely captured and its recapture will require the
      deployment of reserves, which are currently lacking in this area.

      - The Russian Volunteer Corps fighting on the side of Ukraine (RDK) has called
      on all civil and political opposition forces in Russia to unite on a single

      alternative to the Kremlin.

      - Pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash, who is being prosecuted in

    desc: 'Igor Girkin published another letter from prison: ''Ukraine is basing its
      strategy on the exhaustion of Russia, for us it is a protracted and fruitless
      war that is still going on. Many try to forget that the war has been going on
      for almost four years. During this time, we have not only failed to liberate
      Novorossiya, but also to clear the Donbas of the enemy. In the fourth year of
      the war, the enemy began attacking economic and infrastructural targets deep
      in the rear of the Russian Federation, which also does not indicate that we
      are winning the war. Yes, there are frequent reports from the front that we
      have liberated another settlement, but overall the enemy maintains the integrity
      of the front and his army has not collapsed. Therefore, unfortunately, we cannot
      say that victory has already been achieved or that it is very close. Production
      is falling, inflation is rising and economic difficulties are deepening, which
      can no longer be compensated for by drawing on reserves, because these reserves
      are already depleted. The state can no longer continue to wage war as it has
      done for four years, i.e. without switching to a war economy. And this is what
      our so-called "friends" are waiting for: that after a certain period of time
      the Russian economy will enter a spiral of decline, causing a collapse both
      on the front and in the home front, and they will win the war by attrition."

      Shahed drones on Ukrainian territory. It plans to use private properties and
      especially the elderly to do so. Therefore, the authorities warn people to alert
      their elderly parents and neighbours to pay extra attention to suspicious requests
      from unknown persons directed to install any boxes in the house or yard, which
      must be connected to an electrical outlet and, if possible, to the Internet.

      - Odessa is without electricity, water and heating after more than 300 Russian
      missiles and drones targeted civilian infrastructure there this morning. The
      outage has affected around 1 million people. Russia is thus systematically terrorising
      another city with a relatively large Russian-speaking population that the Russians
      falsely claim historically belongs to them. In total, Russia sent 465 drones
      and 30 missiles last night.

      - The Wall Street Journal reports that Russia''s advance in Ukraine has been
      slower than almost any major military operation of the past century. After nearly
      four years of war, Moscow still hasn''t conquered the Donetsk region, which
      has been its target since 2014.

      - Alexei Zhuravlyov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma''s defence committee,
      said in a Russian TV debate: "We have no choice but to keep fighting. We will
      stop in Kiev. All wars end in capitals."

      - Trump is going to bomb Venezuela - there will be ground strikes all over the
      country. Trump says the goal is to end the drug trade. But he also admits, none
      too covertly, that Venezuelan oil is the reason.

      - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has approved the participation of
      Russian and Belarusian youth athletes under their national flags in international
      junior events, including the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar.

      - Long-range drones manned by the SBU''s special Alpha unit again hit the Filanovsky
      oil rig in the Caspian Sea, but this time also the nearby Korchagin platform.

      - The US lifted sanctions on the Belaruskali production facility. Belaruskali
      is a large Belarusian state enterprise, one of the world''s largest producers
      and exporters of potash fertilizers.

      - The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was again without power overnight - for
      the twelfth time. The plant is believed to have lost all external power supplies.

      - Trump is reportedly prepared to provide Ukraine with NATO Article 5 style
      security guarantees in exchange for the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from
      the Donbas.

      - The commander of the Russian neo-Nazi battalion "Espaňola" with the call sign
      "Spaniard" (Czech: "Spaniard") was killed in fighting in Ukraine.

    desc: 'The SBU says it has detained three suspected Russian agents in connection
      with yesterday''s bombing in Kiev that killed a National Guard member. The attack
      was carried out by three Ukrainians from the Odessa and Donetsk regions, aged
      23, 27 and 25. They all worked in construction and were recruited by the Russian
      FSB in an attempt to earn extra money through the Telegram app. Following instructions,

      phones with online transmission. As a result of the attack, one National Guard

      the Russians out of most of the city during the counter-attacks and cut off
      several dozen Russian soldiers from supply routes. Thus, most of the city is
      once again under Ukrainian control.

      - Ukrainian armed forces, in cooperation with the Black Spark guerrilla group,
      hit two Russian ships off the coast of the Republic of Kalmykia in the Caspian
      Sea. The ships ''Composer Rachmaninov'' and ''Askar-Saridja'' were carrying
      weapons and military material. Both vessels were sunk.

      - Ukraine successfully struck the Slavneft-JANOS oil refinery in Yaroslavl Region,
      Russia - one of the largest refineries in Russia with an annual production capacity
      of around 15 million tonnes of oil and gas condensate. There were explosions
      and a large fire at the target site.

      - A Russian drone hit an evacuation vehicle of UAnimals, a non-profit animal
      protection organisation, in the Donetsk region. Two UAnimals employees and two
      animals were in the vehicle at the time of the attack. Fortunately, no one was
      killed.

      - The Russian Central Bank has filed a lawsuit in the Moscow Arbitration Court
      against the Belgian depository Euroclear, arguing that its actions caused harm

      he lost his temper and, after waiting 40 minutes for President Putin, stormed
      into the room where Putin was meeting with President Erdogan.

      - The famous Russian filmmaker Sokurov harshly criticized Putin during the video

      - Russian channels are reporting that a Ukrainian drone attack on an AN-26 military
      transport plane at the Kacha airport in occupied Crimea has left personnel injured
      and dead, according to reports.

      - A supposedly more detailed version of the new US National Security Strategy
      has been leaked to the media, according to which the United States wants to
      persuade Austria, Italy, Hungary and Poland to leave the European Union.

      - Russians hit a Turkish ship in Odessa port. According to preliminary information,
      the ship was carrying generators. This is another piece in the puzzle of anti-Russian
      propaganda about "not attacking civilian targets".

      - US "Secretary of War" Hegseth has excluded Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll
      from negotiations on Ukraine. The reason is Driscoll''s "overly proactive stance."

      diplomatic channels. Donetsk Oblast: A demilitarized zone would be created covering
      about 30% of Donetsk. Ukrainian and Russian forces will withdraw beyond its
      borders. Zaporizhzhya and Kherson: The front line will be frozen and the current
      control of the territory will be recognised. Withdrawal of Russian troops: Under
      the proposal, Russia must leave all other occupied territories outside the five
      named regions (e.g. Sumy, Kharkiv or Dnipropetrovsk oblasts). NATO: the US declares
      that the alliance will not expand further and will not accept Ukraine. No NATO
      troops would be allowed to be deployed on Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian army:
      Authorized post-war size is limited to 800,000 troops. Security: Ukraine would
      receive guarantees similar to NATO Article 5, but without any legal force. Elections:
      must be held as soon as possible after the signing of the agreement. Zaporizhzhya
      nuclear power plant: It will be put back into operation under US supervision;
      Ukraine will get 50% of the energy produced. EU: The plan envisages Ukraine
      joining the European Union on 1 January 2027. Russian assets: The US intends
      to partially release Russian assets. Part of the funds would be used for the
      reconstruction of Ukraine, while another part could be directed to joint US-Russia

    detail: '- According to the Wall Street Journal, the United States has made proposals
      to Europe on how Russia could be reintegrated into the global economy. The US
      plan envisages US investment in key Russian industries such as precious metals
      and even envisages helping to restore Russian energy exports to Europe and the
      rest of the world, in stark contrast to the European strategy of cutting Russia
      off from gas supplies. The proposal also outlines how US financial institutions
      and companies could get involved in projects in Ukraine using some USD 200 billion
      of frozen Russian assets. U.S. actions have caused considerable tension in negotiations
      with European allies, who differ sharply in their ideas about Ukraine''s reconstruction
      and the conditions for future normalization of relations with Russia.

      - The UN General Assembly supported a Ukrainian resolution aimed at strengthening
      international cooperation and minimising the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.
      The document received the support of 97 states. Voting against were Russia,
      Belarus, China, North Korea, Nicaragua, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
      Niger and, unfortunately, the USA.

      - For the first time, Ukrainian forces used remote sensing drones to hit Lukoil''s
      Filanovsky oil platforms, located more than 905 km from the front line in the
      Caspian Sea. They were hit by more than four projectiles, resulting in the shutdown
      of oil and gas production from more than 20 wells.

      - Tucker Carlson said Russia would be the best ally for the United States "because
      it''s the largest territory in the world, with a lot of oil, gas, minerals,
      gold and everything else. From an America First policy perspective, it''s an
      ideal ally."

      - The British soldier who died in Ukraine a few days ago was Corporal George
      Hooley, 28, who was serving in a parachute regiment. He was killed while testing
      an interception drone. Two Ukrainians also died in the accident.

      - Ukrainian drones hit the Akron chemical plant in Veliky Novgorod, Russia,
      a major industrial complex located about 200 km from the Estonian border and
      700 km from Ukraine.

      - In occupied Donetsk, near school 115, a bust of Lance Corporal Michael Gloss,
      the son of the CIA deputy director who died fighting on the Russian side, was
      installed.

      - According to Politico, the United States is considering the creation of a
      new "Core 5" group consisting of the US, China, Russia, India and Japan as an
      alternative to the G7.

      - Since this year, every Finnish soldier has been learning to pilot drones,
      drop bombs, shoot down drones and perform maintenance on them.

      - Kazakhstan supplied oil from the Kashagan field to China for the first time
      after Ukrainian strikes crippled the Russian CPC terminal.

      - The United States seized a tanker carrying a cargo of oil from Venezuela to
      Cuba.

      - Military police intervene at a drone collection - Project Nemesis.

      a large-scale terrorist operation to blow up cargo planes heading from Europe

      - Zelensky responded to Trump''s blathering about the need for elections in
      Ukraine: he called on the US and Europe to ensure the security of the vote.
      If that happens, he said, Ukraine will be able to hold elections within 60 days.
      Russian officials immediately called that bluff.

      - Republican Thomas Massie introduced a bill in the US Congress to withdraw
      the US from NATO, calling the alliance a "relic of the Cold War" and arguing
      that the funds saved should be spent on US homeland security.

      - Mass seizures of property in occupied territories are now officially legal.
      Occupation authorities have been given the power to declare houses "ownerless"

      - According to Ukrainian intelligence, there is a risk of Russian sabotage and
      reconnaissance groups infiltrating the Odessa and Vinnytsia regions. Intensive
      mobilisation is underway in Transnistria, and mass production of drones and
      training of their operators has started.

      - A video has appeared on Russian social media showing the new commander of

    desc: 'In Russian propaganda, it is regularly claimed that the Russian advance
      is what it is (slow) because the Russian army is extremely considerate of the
      civilian population of Ukraine. What does the Russian "liberation" really look
      like? I guess it looks like this: As soon as any city is within range for Russian
      artillery, the systematic terrorization of the civilian population begins. The
      targets are shops, power stations, waterworks, schools, transport infrastructure...
      in short, everything that the civilian population needs to live a normal life.
      The goal is to make normal life in the city simply unsustainable, so that the
      civilian population will leave as soon as possible and Russia can accelerate
      the devastation of the city, which is now left with practically a fraction of
      people with nowhere to go, soldiers, and collaborators who help to direct the
      attacks on the two previously mentioned groups of people. This goes on for weeks,
      months, sometimes years. By the time the tanks and infantry approach the city,
      it is just an empty ruin. Then Russia literally blows all the remaining, still
      standing buildings to s**t. This is usually the point at which the Ukrainian
      army retreats, leaving only paratroopers, special forces and saboteurs to operate
      in the rubble. For the next few months, the Russians conquer the smoking ruins
      at the cost of tens to hundreds (in the case of villages) or thousands to tens
      of thousands (in the case of district towns) of lives, and when there are no
      Ukrainian soldiers left in the town, the Russians declare the town "liberated"
      and take the surviving collaborators to some godforsaken village outside the
      Urals. Then Ukrainian artillery starts leveling the remaining piles of bricks
      and panels, and after a short pause the whole situation repeats itself a few
      kilometres away. The Russians do not even respect the lives of their own soldiers,
      let alone foreign civilians. Then, when the Ukrainian army is far enough away,
      the "reconstruction of the liberated city" begins. This looks like a Chinese
      company moving in on a designated site, building prefabricated boxes instead
      of the original tenements and apartment blocks, moving in a few poor people
      who have believed the domestic propaganda about fabulous real estate at fabulous
      prices, Russian state television coming in to film a glorified report, and the
      new tenants being left to their fate in crumbling apartments without electricity
      or water. The thoughtfulness of it all is oozing out. But there is also [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0qsnqyizr698FAiKU4EBmtoe4bZ4o7i7xZDTZuxBXzdrNsBWi6C3V3eq4H3LMEEtnl):

      \ the article, a virtual minister named Diella was removed from her post for\
      \ accepting a bribe of 14 bitcoins during a selection process. Volodin did not\

      \ Europe that could come within months or years of Trump forcing Ukraine to\
      \ capitulate.\n- A Russian An-22 military transport plane crashed in the Ivanovo\

      war against the whole of Europe. Sergei Karaganov, chairman of the Russian Council
      on Foreign and Defence Policy, said on television that the current war will
      not end until Russia "morally and politically" crushes Europe, because, he said,
      the current European elites are "pushing the world towards a global war". Europe,
      he said, will disintegrate and become "a junkyard of nations at war with each
      other" because it is a source of "evil for all humanity". European propaganda,
      he said, has created an indoctrinated population worse than that of Germany
      at the end of the Second World War. Karaganov therefore hopes that "Europeans
      will come to their senses before Russia has to resort to mass retaliation".

      Donbass. But he insists that peace talks should be derived from the current
      front, not from Russian demands. Indeed, to give up the Donbas would mean ceding
      to Russia a multi-layered defence and a belt of fortress cities built up over
      many years and at the cost of unimaginable losses. Ceding them would also allow
      Russia to use them as footholds for an invasion of the rest of Ukraine.

      - Russia ranks 28th out of 36 in the latest Global AI Ecosystem Development
      Index. Even the best Russian models lag behind older versions of ChatGPT and
      Gemini. While Putin recently identified AI development as a strategic priority,
      thousands of IT talents have left Russia for the West due to emerging totalitarianism
      and war. So now there is no intelligence in Russia. Neither real nor artificial.

      - The European Commission is proposing to distribute financial guarantees among
      EU member states to provide Ukraine with a "reparation loan" financed by frozen
      Russian assets. These guarantees are necessary to persuade Belgium to confiscate
      the 185 billion euros deposited in Euroclear. A further €25 billion is scattered
      across the Union in private bank accounts.

      - Zelensky held talks with European leaders in Britain. The British Prime Minister
      began his address to him by saying "We stand with Ukraine" and stressed that
      any potential ceasefire must be fair and lasting and that decisions on Ukraine
      must be made primarily by Ukraine.

      - Trump let it be known that he was disappointed by the lack of any response
      from Zelensky to Trump''s peace plan. According to Trump, Russia is ready to
      make a deal and Zelensky''s team is said to be excited about it. So sure...

      - According to Zelensky, "overtly un-Ukrainian" proposals were removed from
      the peace plan after the first rounds of negotiations. The draft subsequently
      presented by Witkoff in Moscow was therefore cut from 28 to 20 points.

      - On one of the Russian bombers parked in the hangar, the ejection system suddenly
      activated, with the crew already inside at the time. As a result, the pilot
      and navigator were killed.

      - According to the Ukrainian ombudsman, the Kremlin is preparing a new hybrid
      attack: staged "anti-war" demonstrations across Ukraine, for which it is recruiting
      mothers of fallen soldiers.

      - Russia has charged Robert "Hungarian" Brovdi in absentia for organizing an
      alleged terrorist attack in Russia''s Kursk region and issued an international
      arrest warrant for him.

    detail: "- Several US media outlets claim that Trump and his proxies are pushing\
      \ Ukraine to approve the handover of Donbas to Russia as soon as possible. According\
      \ to Axios, Zelensky was even basically expected to agree to the Donbass cession\
      \ without any further negotiations or compensation during a phone call between\
      \ him, Witkoff and Kushner. But yesterday Zelensky let it be known that the\
      \ Ukrainian representation has no option under Ukrainian, international, and\
      \ ultimately moral law to hand over Ukrainian territories to anyone.\n- Volodin,\
      \ the speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, cited a fake news\
      \ report to justify the upcoming AI regulation in Russia. In his speech to Putin,\
      \ he mentioned a media story about a \"corrupt AI minister in Albania\" - a\
      \ story printed by the satirical Croatian media outlet Newsbar. According to\
      \ the article, a virtual minister named Diella was removed from her post for\
      \ accepting a bribe of 14 bitcoins during a selection process. Volodin did not\
      \ understand that this was a humorous story.\n- When asked by reporters, Trump\
      \ said that \"Russia now has a stronger negotiating position because it's bigger.\"\
      \ He said Zelensky should start accepting offers of reconciliation because he\
      \ is losing on the battlefield. For context, it is worth recalling that according\
      \ to the still valid Budapest Memorandum, the United States (but also Russia)\
      \ is the guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n- The International\
      \ Court of Justice in The Hague has formally accepted Russian charges against\
      \ Ukraine for alleged genocide in the Donbas. Thus, Ukraine must submit a response\
      \ to Russia's allegations by December 7, 2026. Russia must submit its charges\
      \ by December 7, 2027.\n- Trump said that \"it has always been the general consensus,\
      \ even long before Putin, that Ukraine would not be admitted to NATO.\" If he\
      \ wasn't lying, he was inadvertently confirming that Russian propaganda about\
      \ the need to invade Ukraine to expand NATO is being sucked out of thin air.\n\
      - The four men accused of murdering Russell Bentley, an American communist and\
      \ propagandist who fought in the Donbas since 2014 on the side of pro-Russian\
      \ militants, were sentenced to prison terms of up to 12 years.\n- Russian domestic\
      \ propaganda continues to prepare the Russian population for a larger war with\
      \ Europe that could come within months or years of Trump forcing Ukraine to\
      \ capitulate.\n- A Russian An-22 military transport plane crashed in the Ivanovo\
      \ region. Seven people were on board, their fate is still unknown, but it is\
      \ believed that they did not survive the crash.\n- Honduras has issued an international\
      \ arrest warrant for its former president and drug trafficker, who was recently\
      \ pardoned by President Trump.\n- Poland has commissioned its military reconnaissance\
      \ satellite capable of taking detailed images even through clouds or smoke.\n\
      - Ukrainian troops withdrew from Lysiivka and Sukhny Yar in the area south of\
      \ Pokrovsk to avoid being surrounded.\n- Zelensky is on a visit to Rome. He\
      \ has met with the Pope and will later meet with the Italian government.  \n\
      - The Russian censorship authority has banned Russians from accessing the Roblox\
      \ gaming and development platform.\n- Ukraine's Sumy was without electricity\
      \ after a Russian night raid.\n- Trump calls for new presidential elections\

    desc: 'In Russian propaganda, it is regularly claimed that the Russian advance
      is what it is (slow) because the Russian army is extremely considerate of the
      civilian population of Ukraine. What does the Russian "liberation" really look
      like? I guess it looks like this: As soon as any city is within range for Russian
      artillery, the systematic terrorization of the civilian population begins. The
      target is shops, power stations, waterworks, schools, transport infrastructure...
      in short, everything that the civilian population needs to live a normal life.
      The goal is to make normal life in the city simply unsustainable, so that the
      civilian population will leave as soon as possible and Russia can accelerate
      the devastation of the city, which is now left with practically a fraction of
      people with nowhere to go, soldiers, and collaborators who help to direct the
      attacks on the two previously mentioned groups of people. This goes on for weeks,
      months, sometimes years. By the time the tanks and infantry approach the city,
      it is just an empty ruin. Then Russia literally blows all the remaining, still
      standing buildings to s**t. This is usually the point at which the Ukrainian
      army retreats, leaving only paratroopers, special forces and saboteurs to operate
      in the rubble. For the next few months, the Russians conquer the smoking ruins
      at the cost of tens to hundreds (in the case of villages) or thousands to tens
      of thousands (in the case of district towns) of lives, and when there are no
      Ukrainian soldiers left in the town, the Russians declare the town "liberated"
      and take the surviving collaborators to some godforsaken village across the
      Urals. Then Ukrainian artillery starts leveling the remaining piles of bricks
      and panels, and after a short pause the whole situation repeats itself a few
      kilometres away. The Russians do not even respect the lives of their own soldiers,
      let alone foreign civilians. Then, when the Ukrainian army is far enough away,
      the "reconstruction of the liberated city" begins. This looks like a Chinese
      company moving in on a selected site, building prefabricated boxes instead of
      the original tenements and apartment blocks, moving in a few poor people who
      have believed the domestic propaganda about fabulous real estate at fabulous
      prices, Russian state television coming in to film a glorified report, and the
      new tenants being left to their fate in crumbling apartments without electricity
      or water. The thoughtfulness of it all is oozing out. But there is also [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0qsnqyizr698FAiKU4EBmtoe4bZ4o7i7xZDTZuxBXzdrNsBWi6C3V3eq4H3LMEEtnl):

    detail: '- According to the Politico, the US is pressuring Zelensky to give up
      Donbass. But he insists that peace talks should be derived from the current
      front, not from Russian demands. Indeed, to give up the Donbas would mean ceding
      to Russia a multi-layered defence and a belt of fortress cities built up over
      many years and at the cost of unimaginable losses. Ceding them would also allow
      Russia to use them as footholds for an invasion of the rest of Ukraine.

      - Russia ranks 28th out of 36 in the latest Global AI Ecosystem Development
      Index. Even the best Russian models lag behind older versions of ChatGPT and
      Gemini. While Putin recently identified AI development as a strategic priority,
      thousands of IT talents have left Russia for the West due to emerging totalitarianism
      and war. So now there is no intelligence in Russia. Neither real nor artificial.

      - The European Commission is proposing to distribute financial guarantees among
      EU member states to provide Ukraine with a "reparation loan" financed by frozen
      Russian assets. These guarantees are necessary to persuade Belgium to confiscate
      the 185 billion euros deposited in Euroclear. A further €25 billion is scattered
      across the Union in private bank accounts.

      - Zelensky held talks with European leaders in Britain. The British Prime Minister
      began his address to him by saying "We stand with Ukraine" and stressed that
      any potential ceasefire must be fair and lasting and that decisions on Ukraine
      must be made primarily by Ukraine.

      - Trump let it be known that he was disappointed by the lack of any response
      from Zelensky to Trump''s peace plan. According to Trump, Russia is ready to
      make a deal and Zelensky''s team is said to be excited about it. So sure...

      - According to Zelensky, "overtly un-Ukrainian" proposals were removed from
      the peace plan after the first rounds of negotiations. The draft subsequently
      presented by Witkoff in Moscow was therefore cut from 28 to 20 points.

      - On one of the Russian bombers parked in the hangar, the ejection system suddenly
      activated, with the crew already inside at the time. As a result, the pilot

      attack: staged "anti-war" demonstrations across Ukraine, for which it is recruiting
      mothers of fallen soldiers.

      - Russia has charged Robert "Hungarian" Brovdi in absentia for organizing an
      alleged terrorist attack in Russia''s Kursk region and issued an international
      arrest warrant for him.

    desc: 'Russian domestic propaganda is now preparing the Russian population for
      war against the whole of Europe. Sergei Karaganov, chairman of the Russian Council
      on Foreign and Defence Policy, said on television that the current war will
      not end until Russia "morally and politically" crushes Europe, because, he said,
      the current European elites are "pushing the world towards a global war". Europe,
      he said, will disintegrate and become "a junkyard of nations at war with each
      other" because it is the source of "evil for all humanity". European propaganda,
      he said, has created an indoctrinated population worse than that of Germany
      at the end of the Second World War. Karaganov therefore hopes that "Europeans
      will come to their senses before Russia has to resort to mass retaliation".

      But the defendants, Vitaliy Vantsatsky, Vladislav Agaltsev, Vladimir Bazhin
      and Andrei Iordanov, did not know Bentley and became convinced he was a spy.
      They are now accused of torture and physical violence leading to Bentley''s
      death, and of attempting to conceal the crime by transferring Bentley''s body
      to a car, which they then set on fire.

      - Kremlin spokesman Peskov let it be known that Russia welcomes the new US national
      security strategy. First, because unlike the strategies of previous administrations,
      it does not name Russia as a security threat, but also, for example, because
      the Trump administration calls further NATO expansion undesirable, or because
      it outlines a similar vision of the world that Russia wants.

      The newspaper says the situation is not yet critical, but is gradually worsening,
      with the main problem being a continuing shortage of resources and manpower.
      Russia, on the other hand, is said to be taking advantage of its numerical superiority
      and willingness to endure heavy losses.

      - Ukrainian hackers wiped 165 TB of data from Russian logistics giant Eltrans+,
      a key supplier of Chinese electronics to Russian missile factories. Over 700

      - Kellogg says the deal on Ukraine is almost done. Only two points are said
      to be blocking the peace deal. The outstanding issues concern the status of
      the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and the Donetsk region.

      - The volume of foreign currency held by Russians in bank accounts has halved

      volume.

      - Last night, Russian terrorists hit Slavyansk in the Donetsk region. 8 people
      were injured, including a pregnant woman and a 15-year-old boy.

    desc: 'Russia has activated all its foreign influencers in a coordinated information
      attack on Europe. The entire MAGA movement, including its top leaders, is flooding
      the digital space with calls for the dissolution of the EU, a revolution against
      "European bureaucrats" and calls for support for the far right, which it says
      is the only one capable of "stopping censorship and the civilizational transformation
      of Europe." All of this is aided by technocrats like Musk and Durov, who, moreover,
      have already bent the algorithms of their networks in the past to spread such
      propaganda more quickly. Ironically, Russian leaders such as Medvedev and Dmitriyev
      have been widely sharing and commenting on calls to ''end censorship'' across
      all known networks, even though all Western social networks, including Facebook,
      Instagram and X, are banned in Russia. So far, the sharpest reaction in top
      politics has been demonstrated by Polish Foreign Minister Sikorski, who told
      Musk to "fly to Mars where no one will censor Nazi salutes." But the key information
      is that Russia (of course) wants the EU and NATO to break up so that it can
      more easily attack individual states. And anyone who seeks to do the same is
      - consciously or unconsciously - an agent of Russia. Even if it is the US president.

    detail: '- The national poll found that 64% of Americans support providing lethal
      aid to Ukraine, up 9% from last year and the highest share since February 2022.
      Slightly more (65%) support providing long-range missiles like Tomahawks so
      Ukraine can conduct strikes deep inside Russian territory, while 68% support
      selling U.S.-made weapons to European allies who would then provide them to
      Ukraine. By contrast, in 2024, a majority of Republicans (59%) support supplying
      weapons to Ukraine to repel a Russian invasion, up from 44% last year. Three-quarters
      of Democrats support aid to Ukraine, up from 68%. The poll also found that 62%
      of Americans want the war to end with a Ukrainian victory.

      - Russia''s pro-regime military channels fret that Siberian peoples, including
      the Buryats who were colonized long ago, are being decimated in the so-called
      "SVO" while "economic migrants from Central Asia" fill the resulting gaps. The
      arrival of these migrants, they say, is already showing up on the streets, where
      a growing number of "women with their faces covered" can be seen. Thus, while
      Russia funds far-right movements in Europe that fight migration and the ''Islamisation''
      of Europe, Russia has the largest Muslim minority of the ''non-Muslim countries''
      in Europe. Russia is now home to more than 1% of the world''s Muslim population,
      and its share of the Russian population is growing year by year.

      - The Kherson heating plant is definitely out of action after about a hundred
      hits by Russian artillery. This threatens to leave some 30 000 inhabitants of
      the adjacent villages without electricity during the winter. Meanwhile, in 2022,
      after a fake referendum, the Russians claimed that 87% of the region wanted
      to join Russia. If we were to believe their lie, it would mean that the Russians
      have been terrorizing a population they consider ''theirs'' for three years
      without ceasing.

      - Republican politicians and influencers, with the hearty backing of Russian
      and pro-Russian accounts, flooded social media with claims that the European
      Union had fined X/Twitter because Elon Musk refused the Union''s request to
      deploy censorship. In fact, the network was fined for refusing to address transparency
      issues with some features instead.

      - International Criminal Court Deputy Prosecutor Najat Shammim Khan said that
      the investigation into Russian aggression can be suspended for peace talks if
      the UN Security Council requests it.

      - Zakharova said that "the attacks on tankers in the Black Sea and on the infrastructure
      of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium are further examples of the criminal nature
      of the Kiev regime."

      - One of the commanding officers of the 414th "Klim" Brigade was awarded the
      title of Hero of Ukraine and the entire 414th "Hungarian Birds" Brigade received
      its battle standard from the President.

      - According to the IAEA, the radiation sarcophagus of the Chernobyl nuclear
      power plant lost its integrity after the Russian kamikaze drone attack and with
      it its primary safety function.

      - The Swedish Navy reports regular contacts with Russian submarines in the Baltic
      Sea on an almost weekly basis.

      - Russia will raise the tax on alcohol by 30 percent to raise money for its
      war spending.

      - Ukrainian drones again hit a Russian oil refinery in Ryazan.

      - The US offered Poland 250 Stryker armoured vehicles for $1.

      Instead, the Russians "gifted" it with another night of terror of the civilian
      population. There were a total of 683 drones and 51 cruise missiles/flares in
      the air. During the raid, the Russians completely destroyed the railway station
      in the town of Fastiv in the Kiev region. In Dnipro, the warehouse of a popular
      chocolate factory there was hit, as well as a storage area full of medical supplies.
      Debris from one of the rockets landed on a playground in the city centre. Another
      plant was also hit, in western Ukraine near Lutsk. But the Russian report almost

    desc: '31 years ago today, Ukraine signed a series of international agreements
      known collectively as the "Budapest Memorandum". It gave up, among other things,
      its nuclear arsenal in exchange for several countries guaranteeing its security.
      The reality? Of the three guarantors, one has repeatedly attacked it, another
      has tried to sell it to the first, and only one - the UK - has kept its word,
      at least in part. So Russia and the US have basically told every country in
      the world that having nuclear weapons is the only way to keep the peace. Because

    desc: 'In a televised interview, former Russian ground forces commander Vladimir
      Valentinovich Chirkin publicly admitted the fiasco of the Kremlin''s original
      strategy for invading Ukraine. According to him, the Russian intelligence services
      assured the Kremlin that 70% of Ukrainians would support Russia and only 30%
      would oppose it. In fact, the exact opposite was the case - and this, in his
      view, became one of the factors that led to the failure of the "three-day special
      operation". Chirkin also complained that the Russian army grossly "underestimated
      the enemy and overestimated itself" and that the capture of Kiev failed because
      of this, leading to a chaotic retreat from northern Ukraine. The then Defence
      Minister Shoigu is said to have tried to handle the situation gracefully, calling
      what was happening a "gesture of goodwill". We remember that very well, of course.
      The funny thing is that even though Putin''s fiasco has now been admitted by
      a top Russian military official, the Russian fifth column will still continue
      to parrot the propaganda that this was an agreed withdrawal. On the other hand,
      propaganda from the Russian FSB can apparently lie very effectively even to
      its own politicians. So we cannot be surprised that it is so easily succumbed
      to by individuals much less mentally equipped than the Russian President. But

    detail: '- Turkish maritime authorities report that another tanker sailing from
      Russia to Georgia - the MIDVOLGA-2 - has been targeted 80 miles off the Turkish
      coast. But Ukraine - unlike in past attacks - has said it had nothing to do
      with this particular incident and that it may have been a Russian provocation
      aimed at provoking a negative response from Turkish officials. According to
      Putin, in response to the tanker attacks, Russia will increase attacks on Ukrainian
      ports and ships calling at those ports. So here is the possible pretext.

      - The SBU has detained a British instructor who came to Ukraine in 2024 ostensibly
      to train Ukrainian soldiers. According to investigators, he was actually working
      for Russian intelligence: gathering information and supplying the weapons used
      to kill Demyan Hanul, Iryna Farionova and Andriy Parubiy.

      - A Russian sabotage group tried to slip through the ruins of Myrnohrad under
      the cover of fog. A group of Russians broke into a ruined house in the centre
      of Myrnohrad, but was detected by a Ukrainian drone. Ukrainian troops took advantage
      of the poor visibility and quietly surrounded the Russians, who surrendered
      without resistance.

      - Trump gave Maduro until last Friday to leave Venezuela with his family. According
      to two sources cited by Reuters, it was the expiration of the deadline that
      prompted Trump to announce the closure of Venezuelan airspace on Saturday.

      - The U.S. suspended some arms shipments to Ukraine and cut off one of the direct
      lines of communication with German generals who were coordinating aid to Kiev.
      The information came from German General Christian Freuding in an interview
      with The Atlantic magazine.

      - November set a new record for the number of attacks on Russian refineries.
      According to Bloomberg, August held the previous record with 12 attacks. Now
      Ukrainian forces have set a new record: at least 14 attacks on Russian oil infrastructure.

      - Putin met with the head of Russia''s Federal Prison Service, who told him
      that more than 90% of Russia''s convicted prisoners are now "employed." He forgot
      to add that in the Russian military.

      - The Russians complain on their channels that Ukrainian artillery is decimating
      Russian supplies to Pokrovsk, making things difficult for the troops holding
      positions in the city.

      - According to a Russian internal poll, 83% of Russians feel war fatigue, 56%
      want an immediate end to the war and support for its continuation has dropped
      to just 23%.

      - The payment service Wise has started blocking the cards of Russian and Belarusian
      citizens who do not have permanent residence or citizenship in an EEA country.

      - In recent weeks, Ukrainian military intelligence drones have been striking
      valuable pieces of Russian air defence equipment in occupied Crimea on an almost
      daily basis.

      - The Russian State Duma ratified an agreement that allows Russia and India
      to send their troops and military equipment to each other''s territory.

      - One person was killed and five others injured in a Russian attack on a nine-storey
      apartment building in Kramatorsk.

      - Putin said that if Europe starts a war with Russia, Moscow will soon have
      no one to negotiate with.

      - Italy approved a 12th military aid package to Ukraine. However, its contents
      remain secret.

      - The Russians cannot start their Porsches today because of software blocks.

      '
    desc: 'Witkoff and Trump''s son-in-law Kushner arrived in Moscow this morning
      for talks. Putin has already set the stage for the talks in advance by having
      a bizarre propaganda video filmed in which he appears dressed in military camouflage
      and discusses with military and defense ministry officials the breathtaking
      advance on the front and the initiative, which he says is 100 percent in the
      hands of the Russian military. In the video, it is said, among other things,
      that the Russian army has captured the whole of Pokrovsk or Vovchansk, which
      independent analysts say is simply not true, or that the Russian army has "launched
      an operation to liberate the town of Hulyaipol". On this account, Zelensky confirmed
      in his meeting with Macron that there is still fighting in Pokrovsk, and reminded
      that Russia has repeatedly claimed to have captured Kupyansk, while most of
      the city is still held by Ukrainian forces, systematically destroying Russian
      assault groups that infiltrate the city. However, the video is probably intended
      to impress primarily one potential viewer: Donald Trump. And that''s where Putin
      has an easy time with persuasion, as recent weeks have made clear. Alarmingly,
      however, the Chinese foreign minister flew to Moscow at the same time as the
      Americans for talks. And this is also happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0vncBRAbAijGFX7FG8kN5Fa4vkPmxb3csFE7E8gkNJ2JKYYotCydahMDVsmhHCdokl):

    detail: '- 34 years ago today, Ukraine clearly voted in a national referendum
      that it did not want to be part of the Russian world. At that time, 83% of all
      the inhabitants of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions voted in favour of Ukrainian
      independence, and even 54% of the inhabitants of Crimea, which the Russians
      had been systematically colonising for decades, replacing the indigenous population
      with ethnic Russians.

      - According to new information, one of the victims of yesterday''s Russian airstrike
      on Vyshhorod is one of the team of missile designers at FirePoint, the company
      that produces Flamingo missiles. So it was not a stray missile or downed debris,
      but a totally targeted strike, in which the Russians took no account of how
      many other people - civilians - would die in the strike.

      - Ukrainian military intelligence launched another successful bomb attack on
      the occupiers in Berdyansk. This time, a bomb exploded under a propaganda billboard
      at the entrance to the town, where the occupiers were holding a meeting. The
      explosion killed 5 of them, wounded 4 others and also damaged their armoured
      vehicles.

      - Russia is escalating its control over the internet. Threats of fines have
      not brought the expected shift of Russians away from VPN services. As a result,
      Russians are now losing access to the internet altogether. When a connection
      provider detects VPN access, it simply cuts the connection.

      - A car exploded in a Moscow housing estate. According to reports, the car belonged
      to a scientist from the Moscow Laser Research Institute "Polyus", a doctor of
      physical and mathematical sciences. But the vehicle was empty at the time.

      - NATO manoeuvres have begun in Finland near the Russian border. The Northern
      Axe 25 exercise is taking place in the Kainuu region, which borders Karelia.
      More than 3,000 troops are taking part, including troops from the UK.

      - Putin signs a draft state budget with a record large component for the defence
      ministry. Russia will spend at least $166 billion on the war against Ukraine
      in 2026.

      - The Netherlands has committed to buy 250 million euros ($290 million) worth
      of US weapons for Kiev in a PURL mechanism.

      - Kazakhstan and Turkey have asked Ukraine to stop attacking elements of Russian
      oil infrastructure in the Black Sea.

      - The Russians sent ballistic missiles to Dnipro in broad daylight. One of them
      hit a residential area, killing four people and injuring approximately 40 others.

      - Putin signed a decree allowing Chinese citizens 30-day visa-free entry into
      Russia.

      - Almost half of Russian oil companies are now losing money because of the sanctions.

      - Zelensky met with Macron in Paris and is due to visit Ireland for the first
      time tomorrow.

      - Russia has announced that it will begin evacuating its citizens from Venezuela.

    desc: 'On Twitter, Telegram and TikTok there is currently another continuation
      of the Russian campaign "why there is no footage of the fighting in Ukraine".
      This time the narrative being peddled is "If the Russian army is so bad, why
      isn''t it executing defenseless Ukrainian prisoners?" In fact, just in the last
      few days, several videos have emerged showing the Russians doing exactly that.
      And that''s why Russian propaganda is reacting this way. This type of propaganda
      is designed to put the complete opposition to any claim and create the impression
      in the minds of less informed people that the truth either does not exist or
      is "somewhere in the middle". At the same time, it relies on the fact that the
      vast majority of the population will never see such hard evidence (videos),
      partly because such content does not penetrate them, but also because even if
      it did, most people would rather not view it - they are not built for such raw
      content. Often, such Russian propaganda takes on completely absurd, cynical
      forms, denying even the most basic facts just so that there will be a "contrary
      opinion". In the same vein, the Russians spread claims such as the aforementioned
      "where is some footage of the war?" (as if there were none) or "there is no
      evidence that the Russians bombed civilians" (even though they do it every day
      and most of it is on video). But you''ve known that for a long time, so let''s

      drone. This time, however, it was extremely far away: off the coast of Senegal.
      After the hit, the tanker M/T Mersin started to take on water quickly and by

      about the details of the negotiations between Steve Witkoff and Kirill Dmitriev.
      According to WSJ sources, the negotiations between Dmitriev and Witkoff lasted
      nine months. Officials in the U.S. Treasury Department''s Sanctions Review Division
      often learned about the details of these meetings only from their British counterparts.
      Ahead of a planned Russia-U.S. summit in Alaska, Dmitriev and Witkoff reportedly
      discussed a possible prisoner swap. According to the CIA and the State Department,
      they were not fully briefed on these discussions. Then, a few days after the
      Anchorage summit, the European Intelligence and Situation Centre sent a report
      to several senior European national security officials. The contents of the
      document ''shocked'' European officials because it described the trade and economic
      plans that the US and Russia were discussing together. Among them was a rare
      metals mining project in the Arctic, with a stake in the project going to a
      longtime friend of Trump Jr.

      destroyed by air defenses. Half of Kiev is without electricity and there are
      at least 2 dead and 37 wounded in the city. The New Post Office distribution
      centre, the Terminal shopping centre and several residential buildings were
      hit.

      - German naval bases recorded the highest number of drone sightings in October,
      with the total volume of overflights over military bases reaching record levels.
      Until now, however, the primary targets for reconnaissance have been German
      army and air force facilities.

      - The Ukrainians have added tankers from the Russian shadow fleet sailing through
      the Black Sea to their "sanctions list". Sea Baby naval drones hit two of these
      tankers last night: the Kairos and the Virat, which were on their way to Novorossiysk
      to load oil.

      - Russian forces now control approximately 30% of Kupyansk. Small infantry units
      are operating in the city, but the area west of the Oskil River remains a grey
      zone which the Russians are unable to effectively resupply because of the heavy
      losses caused by Ukrainian drones.

      - At the Yasnyy test range near Orenburg, a rocket exploded after barely leaving
      the ground during a practice launch. Ukraine''s Defense Express suggested it
      may have been a Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile.

      - The Ukrainian military attacked the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) naval
      terminal near Novorossiysk using naval drones. As a result, one of the berths
      was severely damaged and can no longer be used.

      - The special economic zone in Yelabuza, where the Russians assemble their Shaheeds,
      is in flames. The fire broke out in a battery factory that produces cells for
      cars and trucks such as Lada.

      - Swedish Foreign Minister: ''It is obvious that Russia does not want peace.
      Those parts of the world that still believe in a rules-based world order must
      immediately increase their support for Ukraine and put more pressure on Russia."

      - Jordan is demanding that Russia stop recruiting its citizens in the online
      space and end existing contracts after two Jordanians were reportedly killed
      while serving in the Russian armed forces.

      - Vasyl Verameychyk, a Belarusian soldier who fought for Ukraine in the Belarusian
      Legion, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in Belarus after he was kidnapped
      from Vietnam, where he was vacationing.

      - Zelensky appointed Rustem Umerov as head of the Ukrainian delegation to the
      peace talks, replacing Andriy Yermak, who resigned due to the current investigations.

      - A giant Ukrainian An-124 cargo plane was spotted in Israel, where it had visited
      to pick up an unknown cargo.

      - Putin yesterday suggested "officially declaring" that Russia has no intention
      of invading Europe.

      - Ukraine has again hit the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia''s Krasnodar region.

      - The Russian city of Kazan was plunged into darkness after an explosion at
      a nearby electricity substation.

      - Donald Trump''s son Eric announced the launch of Trump brand vodka.

      Ukrainians are not fighting ''for Zelensky'' - they are fighting for their right
      to life, their freedom and their dignity. Since 2014, they have been waging
      a war on two fronts: against Russia''s genocidal murderers and against their
      own corrupt politicians. The successful raids by anti-corruption organisations
      are therefore not a sign of weakness, but on the contrary, they demonstrate
      the strength of institutions even in the current difficult times. A strength
      of institutions that is unfortunately not self-evident even in the most free

    detail: '- Frustration is growing in the Russian ranks at the mounting losses
      and the small shift in the front. Cases of war crimes by Russian soldiers are
      therefore multiplying. In recent days, several videos have emerged of Russians
      shooting handcuffed Ukrainian prisoners. Most recently, another video emerged
      yesterday of Russians shooting five defenceless, lying soldiers after capturing
      and interrogating them following a chaotic Ukrainian retreat to sections of
      the frontline near the town of Hulyaipol. Another video, this time from the
      helmet camera of a Russian soldier, captured his colleague first bashing the
      head of a handcuffed Ukrainian prisoner with the butt of his rifle and then
      shooting him. The crime took place near Hnativka, near Pokrovsk.

      - The Baikonur accident has virtually deprived Russia of the ability to send
      people into space for the first time in 60 years. During the launch of the Soyuz
      MS-28, the service tower on launch pad 31 collapsed. This is the only place
      from which crews can be sent to the International Space Station. The astronauts
      escaped unharmed, but the ramp was severely damaged and some estimates suggest
      it could take up to two years to repair.

      - Trump''s peace plan, reportedly agreed to by Ukraine, was delivered to the
      Kremlin. An updated version is being kept secret even from European officials.
      According to one diplomat, the contents are deliberately being kept secret because
      of the leak of the previous US 28-point plan to the press.

      - Belgium is throwing a pitchfork into the EU''s plan to use frozen Russian
      assets as a "reparations loan" to Ukraine. Politico reports that Prime Minister
      Bart De Wever sent a letter to Ursula von der Leyen arguing that confiscating
      Russian assets would prevent peace.

      - The head of European diplomacy recalled that Russia has invaded more than
      19 countries in the last 100 years, some of them three or four times. None of
      these countries has ever attacked Russia.

      - Russian collaborator and current Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán arrived
      in the Kremlin for talks with dictator Putin on energy supplies and a peace
      plan for Ukraine.

      - One of the four Ukrainians who were arrested in Poland on suspicion of sabotaging
      the Polish railroad was carrying a whopping 46 Russian passports and other Russian
      documents.

      - The Russian Safari has more tragic victims. Russians hit an FPV passenger
      car with a drone in Kherson, killing 34-year-old Alina and her 6-year-old son
      Vladyslav.

      - The European Parliament adopts a resolution demanding that the EU be invited
      to the negotiating table and that frozen Russian assets be handed over to Kiev.

      - Zelensky did not sign Trump''s original peace proposal. Meanwhile, Trump''s
      deadline for signing it expired at midnight today.

      - Moldovan authorities have begun revoking the citizenship of ethnic Russians
      with Moldovan citizenship who have joined the Russian military.

      - A 21-year-old Ukrainian man died in Vienna. His body was found in a burnt-out
      car. Police do not yet know who killed the man.

      - Actors Ivan Trojan and Jiří Dvořák brought ambulances and medical material
      from the Memory of the Nation collection to Ukraine.

      - Italy extradited a Ukrainian citizen suspected of involvement in the sabotage
      of the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany.

      of the largest airstrikes on targets in Russia. Explosions have been reported
      at three Russian military airports, for example: Saratov, Engels and Rostov.
      Russian energy infrastructure, including the Saratov oil refinery, was also
      hit. Explosions have also been heard in Smolensk and Saky in Crimea, for example.
      Ukrainian drones also again hit the Beriyev plant in Taganrog. The total extent
      of the damage caused by the overnight airstrike is not yet known. Of course,
      Russian official sources are keeping the successful hits under wraps, so there
      is nothing to do but wait for videos from Russian civilians, who always immediately

      not for Syria - for one single war: to protect free Europe from Russian aggression.
      Ukraine is now the only country that is actually fighting this war, and we are
      still debating: whether to admit it to NATO or not! (...) Ukraine is the only
      country that embodies the purpose of NATO! Thanks to Ukraine, Russia has not

      Ukraine is forced to accept the current agreement, it is absolutely clear that
      Putin will realize his dream. And you are next. But you dare not fight."

      in which two US National Guard members were shot near the White House, to portray
      the shooter as a liberal, a leftist, a product of Biden''s immigration policies,
      or even a supporter of Ukraine. However, the investigation revealed that the
      perpetrator was Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan who arrived in the US in 2021
      but was granted asylum in mid-2025 by the Trump administration.

      - The New York Times claims that US Army Secretary Driscoll actively intimidated
      European diplomats with Russian missiles while promoting his "peace plan" for
      Ukraine. According to the newspaper, he claimed that Moscow was expanding its
      long-range arsenal and could launch a "devastating" attack that would "extend
      beyond Ukraine''s borders" if the war was not ended quickly.

      - A Russian flight attendant working for Ural Airlines was sentenced to seven
      years in prison for posting on a local Telegram group that the Russian military
      had committed violence against her friends in Ukraine. According to the court,
      she was guilty of "spreading false news about the Russian military."

      - CNN reports that Donald Trump plans to invite Poland to attend next year''s

      its state-owned railway company, which currently has debts of $51 billion.

      own soldiers in the village of Mainila, near the Finnish border, to falsely
      accuse Finland of military aggression and to create a pretext for its forthcoming
      invasion. In the ensuing Winter War, Finland inflicted absolutely crushing losses
      on Moscow''s armies, yet lost part of Karelia and several islands. Stalin justified
      the war by, among other things, the need to create a buffer zone near Leningrad
      (now St Petersburg). Unlike Putin''s virtually identical lies, however, the
      world leaders of the day did not fall for it and expelled the Soviet Union from

      combat operations indefinitely. Driscoll also argued that the situation in Ukraine
      will only worsen over time and that it is better to reach a peaceful settlement
      now than to find oneself in an even weaker position in the future. But military
      analysts say these claims are simply not true, especially the one about the
      endless possibilities for Russia, which has long teetered on the edge of an
      economic precipice. Although the situation on the battlefield is undoubtedly
      unfavourable for the Ukrainians, the whole thing comes across more as a creation
      of pressure than an objective assessment of reality.

      - Counter-intelligence in Paris arrested a Frenchman and a woman of Russian
      origin with a French passport. They are accused of "collaborating with a foreign
      state" and gathering information for Moscow. According to the media, they are
      believed to be Anna Novikova, founder of the "SOS Donbass" organisation. The
      second detainee is Vincent Perfetti, the current head of the organisation.

      - The Speaker of the Moldovan Parliament, Igor Grosu, announced that Moscow
      tried to influence the parliamentary elections held on 28 September by massively
      supporting pro-Russian candidates and even using Moldovan criminal structures
      to do so. It is the same everywhere.

      - Russia claims that it will not make any concessions as part of the peace agreement
      on the war with Ukraine. Trump has made similar statements, letting it be known
      that Russia''s concession is already that it will stop attacking and taking
      more territory.

      - The Russians continue to systematically destroy Ukrainian power plants and
      key energy substations in order to cause the total collapse of the Ukrainian
      energy system and with it the entire Ukrainian society during the coming winter.

      - Defence Minister and Chairman of the National Security Council Rustem Umerov
      has been summoned to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau to testify in the case
      of Timur Mindich.

      - China is emerging as the big winner in the Russian oil crisis. Sanctions forced
      Moscow to make significant discounts, saving Beijing billions.

      - Ukraine still holds some positions in Pokrovsk, but the Russians are slowly
      advancing to neighbouring Myrnohrad.

      - The Russians attacked with tanks, MT-LBs and six Ulan vehicles near the village
      of Verbove, but were greeted by Ukrainian FPV drones.

      - The United States is negotiating with the Lukashenko regime for the release

    detail: '- Russian forces broke through Ukrainian defences north of Hulayapol
      after capturing Uspenivka, a key Ukrainian stronghold on the west bank of the
      Janchul River. The breakthrough came after Russia concentrated some 40,000 troops
      on the fortress and fired over 400 shells a day to destroy all fortifications.
      After capturing Uspenivka, Russian forces advanced along a 15-kilometre front
      and penetrated as deep as 8 kilometres. The Ukrainian command ordered a withdrawal
      to the Zarichna River, prioritizing personnel protection over holding problematic
      positions. The river line offers favorable terrain for continued defense.

      - The Russian neo-Nazi and ideologue Dugin wrote on Telegram that Russia will
      occupy all of Ukraine within two years, thus ending Ukrainian sovereignty for
      good, because "Ukrainians don''t know what to do with it." In the text, Dugin
      also says that Russia has developed a detailed plan to integrate Ukrainian society
      into the "Russian world," which includes new textbooks, books, "mass re-education"
      programs, or new names for Ukrainian regions and cities. According to Dugin,
      it is still being debated whether Ukrainian, which he calls a "neo-Nazi dialect,"
      should be preserved or completely erased.

      - Ukrainian media report that Washington has handed Kiev a separate draft of
      new security guarantees. It contains three points: if Russia launches another
      offensive, the US president will have the authority to deploy US armed forces
      and intelligence assets. NATO - along with France, Britain, Germany, Poland
      and Finland - will be required to act in coordination with the United States.
      The guarantees would remain in place for 10 years.

      - Russia destroyed the last functioning power unit in the Chernihiv region after
      three days of incessant airstrikes. The Chernihivoblenergo facility was hit
      directly, its equipment completely destroyed. Concrete walls were in place,
      but the roof was not completed and the entire shelter would take months to complete
      and cost tens of millions more.

      - Other sources confirm: Ukrainian paratroopers from the 425th "Skala" regiment
      fought their way back into the centre of Pokrovsk and drove Russian forces out
      of the area around the railway station, the pedagogical school and Sobornyi
      Park. These actions have so far blocked Russian attempts to regroup and reinforce
      from the north. Any Russian movement across the railway line now faces heavy
      casualties.

      - Ukrainian media, citing sources, report that negotiations between the Ukrainian
      and US delegations in Geneva have hit two major obstacles - the withdrawal of
      Ukrainian armed forces from the Donbas and Ukraine''s membership in NATO.

      - An unnamed U.S. official described the situation at the White House: "You
      tell Trump, ''I''m going to try to make a deal,'' he says, ''Great, we''ll see
      what we can do,'' and that''s about all he knows about it."

      - Russian military channels say North Korean soldiers will be deployed to fight
      on the Zaporizhzhya front in Ukraine after two months of training in Russia.

      - At least 4 people have died in overnight shelling of Kharkiv by the Russian
      army. Another 17, including two children, were wounded.

      - Lithuanian trucks are still not allowed to leave Belarus, although the border
      crossings have been officially reopened.

      Turkish airspace near the border with Syria. De facto, it was a direct military

      Turkish bases or cities? No, no and no. Nothing happened. Except that Russia
      turned tail at the time and never allowed itself a similar provocation against
      Turkey again. Because Russia has the mentality of a schoolboy who bullies his

      Since the beginning of the year, debts that companies and individual entrepreneurs
      have not repaid on time have increased by 1.9 trillion roubles and by 600 billion
      roubles in the third quarter. A number of mining and metallurgical companies,
      hit by falling demand and prices for their products, have called for debt restructuring
      in recent months. Earlier, the oil and gas industry, which has faced sanctions
      and a sharp drop in oil prices, also had credit problems.

      - Reuters reports that nearly 200,000 Ukrainian citizens who have entered the
      United States since 2022 now risk losing their legal status. This is due to
      huge delays in processing extensions of stay - people can find themselves without
      valid documents literally overnight.

      - A meeting with national security advisers of the leaders of the UK, France
      and Germany took place in Switzerland. Another meeting followed with delegations
      from the US and Ukraine. Reuters reports that Rubio and Witkoff are on the ground
      for the US.

      - Rescue work has been completed in Ternopil - six people were never found under
      the rubble. All six, including one child, are listed as missing. That brings
      the total number of people killed in the Russian airstrike to 33. Ninety-four
      were injured, including 18 children.

      have cleared the centre of Pokrovsk and are continuing to push Russian troops
      to the outskirts of the town. Fighting continues in the streets, but positions
      in the city centre remain under Ukrainian control.

      - Investigators believe that Yuri Sizov of the Russian GRU military intelligence
      unit No. 92154, also known as the 322nd Special Training Centre or "Senezh",
      and smuggler Yevgeny Ivanov are responsible for the recent sabotage on the Polish

      of bonuses for signing military contracts, although just a few months ago these
      payments were increased to 2.7 million rubles.

      - Personnel at Volkel air base in the Netherlands deployed ground weapons after

      According to Reuters, the Russians handed it over to the Americans at a secret
      meeting with Trump''s associates in Miami, Florida. This is confirmed by other
      politicians who, moreover, claim that it is not an American proposal at all,
      but only Russian conditions that the Americans were supposed to convey to their
      partners in Ukraine as intermediaries. The US Secretary of State, however, insists
      that this is a document co-authored by the United States and Ukraine, but adds
      in a roundabout way that it is not an ''American plan''. Ukrainian Minister
      Umerov is also said to have attended the meeting in Florida, but claims that
      he was not involved in the drafting of any document and that he was only told
      by the meeting participants that a document was being prepared. Some analysts
      therefore speculate that the Russians purposely leaked their proposal to the
      US media as an "American plan" in order to cause information chaos and panic.

      to transport 9 tonnes of cocaine. The plan had been carefully planned: the ship
      was to sail from Panama to Morocco and to be loaded with a huge consignment
      of cocaine in Venezuela. But the operation failed miserably. One of the crew
      died during the voyage and the captain was forced to dock in Cape Verde. There,
      police searched the ship and discovered the entire cargo. A Cape Verdean court
      has already sentenced 11 Russian sailors to 10-12 years in prison.

      - including at the level of leaders - our red lines are clear: There will never
      be any formal or other recognition of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied
      by the Russian Federation as Russian territory. Our country is not for sale.
      Ukraine will not accept any restrictions on its right to self-defence or on
      the size and capabilities of its armed forces. We will not tolerate any violation
      of our sovereignty, including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we
      wish to join. We will not reward the genocidal intentions underlying Russian
      aggression by undermining our identity, including our language. 2) Peace requires
      enhanced security and sustained financial assistance to Ukraine. Strengthening
      Ukraine''s defence capabilities is not escalation - it is the only way to get
      Russia to engage constructively in international peace efforts. In this regard,
      we express our deep gratitude to all partners and allies. 3) The Kremlin regime
      will not stop unless it is stopped. There is only one realistic way to end this
      war: Russia must be forced to retreat - economically, politically and militarily."

      the Liberian-flagged CHAI (56,000 tonnes), the Bahamas-flagged COAST BUSTER
      and the Russian-flagged SATURN. The smaller ship Nord was also damaged. The

    desc: 'According to a study conducted by the United Nations High Commissioner
      for Refugees (UNHCR) and Deloitte, Ukrainian refugees will generate a staggering
      2.7% of Poland''s GDP in 2024. "The study shows that the entry of Ukrainian
      refugees into the Polish labour market has not had a negative impact on the
      economy, such as an increase in unemployment or a decline in real wages; on
      the contrary, it has contributed to an increase in employment of Poles and to
      an improvement in the productivity of Polish companies and employees. All the
      evidence shows that Ukrainian refugees will continue to have a positive economic
      impact as long as they remain in Poland, far outweighing the cost of any support
      they have received." Moreover, it is not only Ukrainians employed in Polish
      companies who are contributing to the success, but also companies directly founded
      by Ukrainian refugees. The situation is therefore similar to that in the Czech
      Republic, where the benefits of refugees have long outweighed the support provided.
      Therefore, if some politicians are calling for Ukrainians to be deported back
      to their homeland, they should explain how they intend to replace their contribution
      to national economies. And that''s what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02bpjZkhoowLpisio3mYr2YpydDQPxtMoQCjdSKePZPFb71V4Ci9rwdAutT7Ek3WsPl):

      punishment for those involved in "sabotage, terrorist and subversive activities"
      from the age of 14. Offenders will face up to 20 years in prison. This is clearly
      Russia''s response to the wave of sabotage that has crippled Russian rail transport,
      and the law is intended to serve as a deterrent to further acts of subversion,
      often perpetrated by teenagers.

      - The Russians attempted a raid on Orichiv using 26 tanks and armoured vehicles.
      The Ukrainians destroyed 22 of them during the move. The Russians then used
      FPV drones to hit their own soldiers who survived the massacre and wanted to
      surrender.

      - Near the front, Die Welt journalist Ibrahim Naber and his cameraman were wounded
      by shrapnel when a Russian Lancet drone landed on a vehicle nearby. One Ukrainian
      soldier was also killed and another seriously wounded in the attack.

      - The Russians launched another large mechanised attack north of Pokrovsk. The
      Ukrainians destroyed 15 of 29 tanks and armoured vehicles. FPV drones subsequently
      took care of the infantry that had been dropped.

      - Russian Sakhalin was without power. Authorities say it was a fault in the
      power lines. But witnesses say the blackout was preceded by a strong flash.

      - According to new information, the Russian helicopter that was shot down yesterday
      was hit by its own air defense system, which mistook it for a Ukrainian drone.

      - The giant floating crane PK-700 Grigory Prosjankin, under construction in
      occupied Sevastopol, capsized and sank.

      - Orbán plans to create an anti-Ukrainian bloc of states within the EU and has
      invited Slovakia and the Czech Republic to join.

      - According to Zelensky, the Ukrainians now face roughly eight times the odds
      near Pokrovsk.

      - The Ukrainians hit the chemical plant near Brnansk with Storm Shadow missiles.

      - Russia''s Lukoil has announced it will sell its foreign assets because of
      losses.

    desc: 'Russian missiles and drones landed in Kiev last night on the premises of
      Optima-Pharm, the largest warehouse of medicines and medical supplies in Ukraine.
      The entire complex subsequently burned down in a fire. Other missiles hit the
      coffee roasting plant of Idealist, Ukraine''s largest producer of drip coffee.
      At this point, the Russian air raids are completely devoid of military meaning,
      but they are pure terror aimed at breaking the morale of the civilian population.
      One of the Russian drones also hit an apartment block in Kiev, killing three

    detail: '- Putin says Russia has successfully tested a new ballistic missile,
      the Burevestnik, capable of hitting anywhere on the planet while evading air
      defences. It has a range of up to 14 000 km and can carry a nuclear warhead,
      according to Putin. Russia is thus probably shrugging its shoulders at the United
      States to deter it from further arming Ukraine.

      - Russia has published a new manual explaining to teachers how to "re-educate"
      children in the occupied territories, especially those who show anti-Russian
      sentiment or openly support Ukraine.

      - The Ukrainians are taking the gloves off. Ukrainian drones have hit and damaged
      a dam in the Belgorod region, which, if breached, would flood several villages
      where Russian army positions are located.

      - German police shot and killed a drunk Russian man in a Chinese restaurant
      in Bielefeld after he threatened to blow up the restaurant and tried to attack
      police officers.

      - Russians killed an 84-year-old elderly woman, Lora, near Kherson as she was
      taking her goats to pasture. A grenade blast tore off both her legs and she
      succumbed to her injuries at the scene.

      - Lithuania closed its border with Belarus for the second time in two days because
      of smuggling balloons. The President of Lithuania described it as a hybrid attack.

      - The presidential election in Ireland was won by Connolly, a critic of the
      EU, NATO and military aid to Ukraine.

      - Ukraine''s Pravda reports that Russian soldiers are targeting Ukrainian drones
      and artillerymen in Pokrovsk.

      - Lavrov said that Russia is not aware of any violation of the Budapest Memorandum.

      - According to a Russian opinion poll, the greatest leaders in Russian history
      are Putin and Stalin.

      - The deputy chairman of the German AfD announced his intention to fly to Moscow
      for political talks.

      - The Ukrainians liberated two more villages in the frontline sector north of
      Pokrovsk.

      - Indian refiners began buying oil in Qatar and Iraq because of sanctions.

    desc: 'The situation in Pokrovsk is rapidly deteriorating after the Russians infiltrated
      the city. Up to two hundred Russians are currently holding positions in the
      city itself. The fall of the city is almost certainly a matter of days, weeks
      at most. It is almost impossible to resupply the city and it is impossible to
      rotate, as most of the routes are controlled by FPV drones. The situation is
      further complicated by the fact that the Ukrainian army is desperately trying
      to evacuate civilians instead of devoting itself fully to defence. Thus, sheer
      stubbornness and recklessness is once again costing unnecessary human lives.
      It must be added, however, that some analysts predicted the fall of Pokrovsk
      more than a year and a half ago. Instead, it held on for months to come, and
      the Russian account of its conquest will likely be seen by historians as yet
      another Russian fiasco, despite the outcome. And that''s what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0SvbxryJ7ce2tLbFvrSimECPkJEhR4fQnyv9yWKo17gr2JFbPiL5ST7uJhUPDtkQml):

    detail: '- Putin''s envoy Kirill Dmitriev appeared on Fox News during his visit
      to the US, where he told viewers that US sanctions against Russia are ineffective,
      confirmed his plan to meet with Trump''s team and said Russia is open to providing
      security guarantees to Ukraine if Ukraine is a neutral country and gives up
      some territory, which he justified with the usual propaganda about Ukrainian
      attacks on Russian-speaking civilians. Dmitriev also claimed that Ukraine, not
      Russia, was holding up peace talks.

      - Ukrainian intelligence has documented a war crime committed by Colombian "mercenaries"
      fighting against Ukraine as part of the 30th Independent Motorized Rifle Brigade,
      which belongs to the 2nd All-Union Army of Russia''s Central Military District.
      In the intercepted conversation, one of the field commanders issues an order
      in Spanish to execute all "enemies" - Ukrainian soldiers, as well as civilians,
      including women and children.

      - According to Budanov, Russia is attempting to cause a complete blackout in
      Ukraine because it believes that the ensuing crisis and social pressure can
      help Russia end the war on its terms. Attacks on civilians to bring about political
      change also have a simpler name: terrorism. It is literally its definition.

      - The Russian propagandist Solovyov declared on his television programme that
      there will be no Kharkov, Poltava, Mykolayiv or Odessa, and no Kiev. At least
      Kharkiv and Odessa are claimed by Russian propaganda to be "Russian" cities.

      - Reuters claims that Washington has prepared further sanctions against Russia''s
      economy and energy sector in case Russia refuses to end the fighting or again
      opts for delaying tactics.

      - Nine ballistic missiles landed on Kiev overnight. Four of them hit parts of
      the heating infrastructure. The airstrikes left at least two dead and twelve
      wounded.

      - Satellite images showed a Russian tanker pumping oil into a Chinese tanker
      on the high seas to avoid Western sanctions.

      - Italy is preparing its twelfth military aid package to Ukraine, focusing on
      strengthening air defences.

      - Britain reports a 30% increase in Russian submarine activity off British shores.

      - Britain provides Ukraine with 5,000 multi-purpose missiles.

      members of one family. The incident occurred on 20 October near the frontline
      west of Bakhmut. The family and their two sons were hiding in the basement of
      the family home. When the younger son went out to fetch water, the occupiers
      broke into the basement where the parents and the older son were and started
      interrogating them about the Ukrainian soldiers. When they got no answer, they
      left at first, but later one of the Russians returned and shot everyone. A 57-year-old
      woman survived by falling unconscious after suffering a gunshot wound to the
      jaw. She later woke up to find that her husband and elder son were dead. She
      immediately found the body of her younger son in the adjacent basement next
      to her neighbours, a 62-year-old woman and her 30-year-old son, who had also
      been shot. The woman managed to walk into Ukrainian-controlled territory, where

      raided an inconspicuous basement space in Riga, dismantling an organised Russian-language
      group that operated approximately 50 MILLION (!!!) fake social media accounts
      through which it organised financial fraud and other illegal activities. During
      the raid, 1,200 SIM card boxes were seized along with 40,000 active SIM cards,
      which the group was not only using itself, but in addition "renting" to other
      criminal groups from around the world for their own criminal activities. Also
      seized were hundreds of thousands of other (as yet) non-functional SIM cards,
      5 servers, 2 websites, hundreds of thousands of dollars and euros in bank accounts
      and cryptocurrencies, as well as 4 luxury vehicles. And all of this was directed
      by five people who were also arrested by the police. So it was a relatively
      small group with a huge hit. This at least gives a better idea of the enormity
      of the problem posed by the ''troll farms'' in Russia, India and South-East

      Tokmačka, during which they lost 2 tanks, 12 armored infantry vehicles, 6 other
      armored vehicles and dozens of soldiers. Such attacks are now typical of Russian
      tactics: an attack by a large column of assorted vehicles, which is usually
      largely dispersed during the movement, but all it takes is for two vehicles
      with infantry to pass and Russia is able to push the front further and further.

      - A joint letter from several European leaders and President Zelensky calls
      for an immediate cessation of fighting on the current line of contact and the

      Trump, who recently proposed this himself and who is mentioned in the letter,
      on his side.

      - Former Russian spy Andrei Bezrukov warned Putin not to go to Budapest. He
      said British intelligence might try to kill him, which would lead to World War

      buy the recently stolen jewels from the Louvre from robbers. But not to return

      Dhabi.

      - The Polish foreign minister warned Russia that if Putin''s plane entered Polish
      airspace, the Polish air force would escort it to the nearest airport and from
      there to The Hague.

      Minister Fico was sentenced to 21 years in prison for terrorism, effectively
      life in prison.

      - The new Russian guided aerial bomb with a rocket engine has a range of around
      200 km and carries a 100 kg warhead.

      to the latest poll. Only 38% of Ukrainians now view the United States positively,
      while only 58% trust Europe. What people who oppose aid to Ukraine may not realise
      is that if Ukraine were to lose and its trust in the West were to sink even
      further, Russia would not only subsequently attack Europe with its military,
      but would find hundreds of thousands of disillusioned and wronged Ukrainians
      in its ranks, with modern weaponry, training and industry and mineral wealth
      capable of feeding an absolutely devastating war for the entire European continent.

      - New videos and updates on map feeds confirm that several groups of Russians
      have managed to infiltrate the centre of Pokrovsk and fortify themselves in
      the train station building and surrounding houses. A drone video then captured
      a situation in which the Russians shot several civilians who had probably unknowingly
      approached their positions.

      - The Council of the European Union has approved a plan to end Russian gas imports.
      Countries should gradually look for other suppliers and then a complete ban
      on Russian gas imports will come into force from January 2028.

      - Latvia has launched a criminal prosecution against a Russian living in Latvia
      who was caught on video insulting a Ukrainian on a train in Switzerland and
      threatening to kill him.

      - Bulgaria''s foreign minister has indicated that if peace talks in Budapest
      go ahead, Bulgaria is likely to allow Putin to fly over its territory.

      against Ukraine for the first time.

      - U.S. Secretary of State Rubio would like to meet with his Russian counterpart
      Lavrov on Thursday.

      - Around 7 million people demonstrated against Trump in hundreds of locations

      line of contact as it stands today.

      - According to Zelensky, Russia''s state budget will end up in a deficit of
      around $100 billion this year.

      - Spain is another country that has reported movement of unknown drones over
      critical infrastructure.

      Russia in exchange for peace, Trump said, "Well, Putin will take something.
      I mean, the Russians fought hard for it and Putin won a lot of real estate."
      It is quite frightening that the current president of the most powerful country
      in the world still refers to himself as what he originally was - a real estate
      entrepreneur, and calls the territory of foreign countries "real estate" (property).
      At the same time, it has emerged that Trump on Friday again pressured Zelensky
      to agree to Russian terms to end the war, angrily discarding the maps of the
      front that Zelensky brought to the meeting. However, Zelensky later reiterated
      to the media that Ukraine was not going to make any concessions to Russia as
      the aggressor, and that even if the current conflict ended, Russia would always
      be a danger not only to Ukraine but to the rest of Europe, which is why, for
      example, he was not going to agree to disarm or otherwise weaken Ukraine. Unfortunately,
      such arguments fall on deaf ears among well-read, history-savvy, intelligent

      and maintain the peace."

      - According to Zelensky, there is no way Russia can be said to be winning, and
      moreover, the Russian military is now extremely weak. While it has managed to
      conquer 1% of Ukrainian territory, it has lost 1.3 million soldiers and tens
      of thousands of pieces of equipment in the process.

      - Russian railways are planning massive redundancies because of the poor financial

      previous years, and in 2025 even to a twentieth of the average profits of previous
      years.

    detail: '- Trump wants to meet Putin in person again and the two leaders have
      chosen Budapest as the venue for their next meeting because "they like Viktor".
      However, Germany has told Hungary that if Putin does indeed come, Hungary is
      obliged to detain him, as the Hungarian government''s decision to withdraw from
      the Rome Statute will not come into force until 2026. In addition, Putin would
      have to fly via a NATO country on his way to Hungary, which is also part of
      the International Court of Justice. Orbán, however, promises not to arrest Putin
      but, on the contrary, to welcome him and ensure his safety.

      - According to the Ukrainian media, Russia is attempting to trigger a cascade
      effect with its strikes on Ukraine''s energy infrastructure and thus a complete
      collapse of the Ukrainian energy system. Here it is worth recalling that the
      vast majority of military bases have their own power sources independent of
      the high-voltage grid for just such cases. Russian strikes are thus terrorising
      the civilian population in particular.

      - Azerbaijan has had a former senior official, Ramiz Mehdiyev, arrested. According

      created by Russia.

      - During a phone call with the Americans, Putin''s associate Kirill Dmitriev
      suggested that the two countries build a "friendship tunnel" linking Russia''s
      Chukotka with Alaska, and called on Elon Musk to help fund the project.

      - A court in Rostov, Russia, sent 15 soldiers from Ukraine''s Aydar regiment

      because "it would be the ninth war he''s ended."

    desc: 'Jindřich Rajchl stated on the programme "Máte slovo" that he is in contact
      "with the award-winning Ukrainian journalist Diana Panchenko", who, according
      to him, brings real news from Ukraine. Diana Panchenko is indeed originally
      a Ukrainian journalist, but in the service of Russian propaganda. For years
      before the invasion, she had been unacknowledgedly promoting Viktor Medvedchuk''s
      pro-Russian ''Pro Life'' coalition, then fled to occupied Ukrainian territory
      in mid-2022 and has been living in Dubai since 2024 at the latest, from where
      she produces Russian propaganda, for which she is on numerous sanctions lists
      and is being prosecuted for treason in Ukraine. I would like to believe that
      Rajchl''s open admission that he is in contact with a propagandist of contemporary
      fascist Russia has not escaped the Czech intelligence and other authorities.

      lying and corrupt. So many laws and protocols were broken, just completely broken!!!"
      What is he talking about? I guess only his advancing dementia knows.

      - Russian MP Zhuravlev claims the State Duma has approved retaliatory strikes
      on US cities if Ukraine uses US Tomahawk missiles against targets in Russia.
      It is not clear whether Zhuravlev is telling the truth, but the key is to interpret
      his words as follows: Russia clearly believes that Ukraine will indeed get Tomahawks,
      and at the same time is very frightened of it.

      - In one of Kiev''s upscale bars, an altercation led to a shootout that left
      several injured. The reason for this was allegedly harassment of the ladies
      by one of the guests who, after a confrontation, pulled out a pistol and started
      shooting.

      and other key elements of the energy system. At one point there were 465 kamikaze
      drones and 32 missiles/shots in the air. A total of nine Ukrainian regions were
      at least partially without electricity, but also without hot water, including
      parts of Kiev. In this context, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister has rightly reminded
      us that attacking civilian targets without any apparent military justification
      is a war crime and that creating unbearable living conditions for the civilian
      population beyond what is necessary to wage war is a form of genocide. State
      terrorism it is in any case. But in addition to the energy infrastructure, Russian
      missiles and drones have also hit the purely civilian infrastructure: residential
      homes. One of the Russian drones landed on a block of flats in Zaporozhye, killing
      a seven-year-old boy - coincidentally, the son of a soldier who had recently
      been released from Russian captivity. Dozens of other people were injured. And

      with 3.6 tonnes of cocaine that had crossed the Atlantic from Latin America.
      Building such a vessel is no mean feat. Analysts therefore point out that the
      cartels are likely to have found allies - where else but in Russia. Since the
      1990s, there have been cases of similar narco-submarines being seized with equipment
      and documentation in Russian. In 2020, a 32-metre-long submarine was seized
      in Colombia, also with various components and equipment in Russian. Moreover,
      according to analysts, these submarines are strongly inspired by the design
      of the Soviet Project 865 Piranha-class small submarines.

      - Journalists from Spiegel, De Tijd and Direkt36 claim that Hungary has in the
      past attempted to recruit European Commission staff for espionage. The agent,
      codenamed "V", was supposed to extract information about negotiations and even
      offer bribes for cooperation with Hungarian intelligence in private meetings
      between 2015 and 2017. Since his cover was blown, he has been working as a lieutenant
      colonel at the Hungarian National Information Center. According to journalists,
      two other Hungarian agents were active in parallel. The European Commission
      is preparing an internal investigation into the report. NATO has previously
      restricted intelligence sharing with Hungary.

      - In his meeting with Aliyev, Putin acknowledged the responsibility of Russian
      air defence forces for the downing of the AZAL plane, but Putin said that two
      Russian air defence missiles were fired against a Ukrainian drone that was in
      the vicinity of the plane and did not hit the plane directly, but only exploded
      near it. But this is somewhat at odds with the damage to the fuselage.

      - Russia has massed some 90,000 troops in the Lyman sector and is trying to
      build pontoon bridges across the Zherebec River to attack Lyman. Ukrainian drones
      and artillery are continually destroying the bridges, but at the same time the
      Ukrainians admit that they are often not building them as fast as the Russians.

      - In Russia, one of the MiG-31 drones the Russians use to launch ballistic missiles
      at Ukraine crashed during a landing. According to sketchy information, its landing
      gear failed to deploy, forcing the crew to eject over an uninhabited part of
      the Lipetsk region.

      - According to Zelensky, Ukraine has overcome the situation with a shortage
      of artillery ammunition and now has a slight cushion instead. This is also thanks
      to the Czech ammunition initiative.

      - According to the Taiwanese Ministry of Defence, China is moving additional
      troops to the vicinity of Taiwan and is rehearsing various blitzkrieg scenarios.

      - Trump promised in a meeting with Finnish President Stubb that the United States
      would come to Finland''s aid, though he said a Russian attack was unlikely.

      - ISW analysts warn that Russia has entered "Phase 0" - a psychological operation
      to set the stage for a future war with NATO.

      - Swedish authorities have fined a man who pasted Wagner Group stickers on the
      cars of Ukrainian refugees.

      - Men in Russia are now not allowed to leave the country unless they receive
      an electronic draft order.

    desc: 'Trump has indicated that Ukraine will receive US Tomahawk missiles. However,
      he said he would first want to know how the Ukrainian military plans to use
      them to avoid an unnecessary escalation of the conflict. Russian military bloggers
      are panicking while correctly pointing out that it takes months to train personnel
      to use them, so if the strikes happen in the next few months, it will be obvious
      that the decision was made much earlier, or even that Ukraine has already received
      the missiles and is practicing their use. Back in April, it was reported that
      the United States had approved the sale of up to 163 Tomahawk missiles to the
      Netherlands. And it can be assumed that the Netherlands was planning to buy
      them specifically for Ukraine. But away from speculation and back to the news:

    title: Tuesday
    detail: "- Russian propaganda is now claiming that the British navy is planning\
      \ a false flag attack using pro-Ukrainian Russians and Chinese technology on\
      \ a Ukrainian or European ship in European waters to give the impression that\
      \ China is supporting Russia. There is a catch: of course China supports Russia.\
      \ So it is not clear what this complex construct of Russian propaganda is supposed\
      \ to prove.  \n- A Ukrainian drone hit the cooling tower of Russia's Novovoronezh\
      \ nuclear power plant. However, Rosenergoatom claims that the drones were diverted\
      \ from their course by electronic warfare systems. So the cooling tower was\
      \ probably not the original target of the drones at all.\n- Chelyabinsk is the\
      \ next major Russian city to introduce limits on refuelling. Now a person can\
      \ buy a maximum of 30 litres of petrol or 70 litres of diesel per vehicle per\
      \ day.\n- Russia's RIA Novosti has aired a report in which a Russian soldier\
      \ claims that Poles fighting on the Ukrainian side are being injected with drugs\
      \ that mean they don't have to eat or sleep for two weeks and feel no injuries.\n\
      - In Paris, a car exploded near the residence of the outgoing French Prime Minister\
      \ just as the yuppie Prime Minister, who is also the current French Defence\
      \ Minister, was about to meet with coalition partners.\n- Russian cities from\
      \ Sochi to Anapa are struggling with giant swarms of stinking marbled godwits\
      \ that infest homes to hide from sudden cold temperatures.\n- The Russian refinery\
      \ KINEF had to shut down its ELOU-AVT-6 unit, which represents 40% of the total\
      \ production of this particular refinery, due to Ukrainian air strikes.\n- Slovakia\
      \ handed over a humanitarian aid package to Ukraine containing various construction\
      \ equipment, trucks, demining systems and evacuation vehicles.\n- A spokesman\
      \ for the Ukrainian navy claims that Ukraine has already carried out more than\
      \ 50 raids this year using Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles.\n- The SBU detained\
      \ a Russian legionnaire who volunteered to join Ukrainian forces to actually\
      \ leak information to Russia.\n- Russia already records at least 989 criminal\
      \ \"veterans\" who committed murder or manslaughter after returning from Ukraine.\n\
      - Following the Ukrainian airstrike, the vast majority of the occupied Zaporizhzhya\
      \ region is without electricity.\n- According to the European Commissioner for\
      \ Defence, the Kremlin is realistically considering an attack on a NATO country.\n\
      - Russia again targeted Ukrainian railways: depots in Poltava and Sumy regions\
      \ were hit.\n- Ukrainians at the front captured an Indian who fought in Russian\

      \ \"moral blackmail\" over pressure to admit Ukraine to the EU.\n- Ukrainians\

      8 airports had to suspend operations due to the airstrike. The Russian power
      grid was hit near Belgorod, leaving 24 villages and approximately 40 000 people
      without electricity. Near Bryansk, Ukrainians hit a Russian heating plant. In
      Feodosia, Crimea, an oil terminal was hit, through which fuel flows to Crimea,
      but also to the occupied Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Near Nizhny Novgorod,
      one of Russia''s largest explosives factories, the Sverdlov factory, was hit.
      In Tuapse, a refinery was hit. In Saky, drones attacked an airbase. And in Berezniki,
      1,600 kilometres away, a chemical plant and a water purification plant were
      hit. In short, Russia is betting on a war of attrition, but it is not at all
      certain that it can win it. And that''s what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0araxnxtRkvBAswDmfUV8z1tXkC6tRbg8xQ6Q9LU3LBJJcJuE2r8qQKcKVeqws21Bl):

    title: Monday
    detail: '- Japanese Prime Minister: ''The ceasefire negotiations between the United
      States and Russia remain very worrying. If the world accepts border changes
      achieved by military force, the global order will collapse. Without guarantees
      of Ukraine''s security, any ceasefire will only give Russia time to prepare
      for another invasion. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was the
      third largest nuclear power in the world. Under the Budapest Memorandum, it
      agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from
      Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom. Russia has broken this promise.
      Russia''s invasion of Ukraine is reinforced by its military alliance with North
      Korea. We must also not forget the joint military operations carried out by
      China and Russia around Japan in recent years. Japan faces an extremely harsh
      geopolitical reality because it is neighbouring three authoritarian nuclear
      powers - Russia, North Korea and China. Depending on the terms of the ceasefire,
      the security risks to Japan could increase further. We need to get rid of excessive
      dependence on others and continuously strengthen our own defence capabilities.
      NATO is also showing signs of instability, underlining the growing awareness
      that diplomacy without military power is weak."

      - Ragor, the Ukrainian commander, said the reason the Russians'' success rate
      in shooting down Ukrainian reconnaissance drones has recently jumped is because
      Israel sold Ukraine the powerful RADA radar at the beginning of the year, and
      six months later sold the same radar to Russia.

      - Russian military blogger Romanov claims that the current average lifetime
      of a Russian infantryman is 12 days from the time he signs a contract with the
      military and arrives at the training site. This is because the Russian command
      uses contract soldiers as an expendable force to throw against Ukrainian fortified
      positions.

      - Merz was the first European statesman to declare that Russia was probably
      behind the unknown drones flying over European infrastructure.

      - Former German Chancellor Merkel criticized Poland and the Baltic states for
      allegedly blocking negotiations with Putin to end the war.

      - A Russian drone hit a maternity hospital building in Sumy and damaged its
      roof. Fortunately, people managed to take shelter and no one was injured.

      - Since the beginning of 2025, the "I want to live" project has already recorded
      281,550 Russian casualties, including more than 86,000 killed.

      - Medvedev said that the drones over Europe are meant to intimidate Europe.
      But he also denied that they were Russian.

      - According to Zelensky, Ukraine is now using not only its own drones but also
      its own missiles to strike Russia.

      - Russia''s snout Orbán said Hungary will not accept the euro because he said
      the euro is collapsing.

      - The Netherlands will allocate an additional 55 million euros to help Ukraine.

      - Zelensky: "Ukraine will be in the EU. With or without Orban."

      gaining momentum. Today, a crowd of demonstrators broke into the courtyard of
      the presidential palace. Police are attempting to violently repress the protests.
      The reason for the escalation of the protests, according to the demonstrators,
      is another rigged local elections.

      - The elections in the Czech Republic are over. The openly pro-Russian parties
      totally lost the elections. Enough! is completely out of the chamber, and the
      SPD has fallen slightly despite joining with other entities. In fact, their
      votes were siphoned off by the first ANO. It is impossible to predict how they
      will stand on aid to Ukraine.

      - Russian kamikaze drones hit two passenger trains waiting at the station in
      Shostka near Sumy. More than 30 people were injured. Most of them were probably
      trying to evacuate the town, as there is no running water and no electricity
      or gas after several days of continuous air strikes.

      Around 250 000 bottles of AZNAURI cognac were destroyed.

      near Pokrovsk: "I really don''t have time to remember and process in my head
      all those fallen Russians. There are as many of them as locusts. They are dying
      thanks to infantry, drones, mines, artillery and often surrender too. But they
      keep coming and it never stops. Heavy equipment is almost non-existent. The
      Russians just go around destroying everything with KABs and artillery. The fields
      are full of dead Russians. The roads are littered with corpses, dogs are eating
      them, FPVs with napalm are flying into the bushes with Russians and there are
      fires everywhere. Something is constantly exploding and burning, even in the
      rain. It was the same in Severodonetsk. It''s the same now around Pokrovsk.
      It''s very difficult here. But Pokrovsk is holding on. And the Russians are
      paying hard for it every day. As soon as the winter is over, it will be total
      chaos. Advancing into the enemy''s operational area in winter is a nightmare."

      in which Russian warships targeted Danish vessels and helicopters with radar
      and on-board weapons, and at other times provoked Danish ships by approaching
      them on a collision course and attempting to collide with them. For context,

      \ it has been reported that Putin plans to nationalise the assets of companies\

    detail: '- As a result of the Ukrainian airstrikes, Russia has already lost 38%
      of its total refining capacity. As a result, gasoline production fell by 1 million
      tonnes in September, creating a 20% fuel deficit on the domestic market. Russia
      is now considering importing gasoline from China, South Korea or Singapore to
      stabilise the domestic market.

      - Russia has been trying in vain for several days to fight its way to the troops
      who have been surrounded north of Pokrovsk. But most attempts to resupply troops
      or move reinforcements have been stopped by Ukrainian FPV drones. To that end,
      the Russians have moved their elite formations into the sector in question.

      - The Ukrainian army successfully liquidated the collaborator Vladimir Leontyev,
      who until recently held the post of mayor in the Russian-installed occupation
      administration of Novaya Kakhovka. After being hit by a drone, Leontyev was
      taken to hospital where he succumbed to serious injuries.

      - On 28 September, a Turkish truck driver, Tevfik Bektaş, was killed in an airstrike
      on Kiev while bringing electric generators to Ukraine. He tried to take cover
      from the blasts in the cab of his vehicle, which was then directly hit by a
      Russian missile.

      - For the eighth time during the night, Russia bombed the large Barabashovo
      market area in Kharkiv. Hundreds of shops were burned in the ensuing fire and
      others were damaged. At least six people were injured in the airstrike.

      - France intercepted the Russian Shadow Fleet tanker Boracay near Saint-Nazaire.
      Its crew refused to provide the coastguard with proof of the vessel''s nationality
      and refused to cooperate with the authorities.

      - Another refinery is burning in Russia - as far away as Yaroslavl. But Russian
      authorities say Ukrainian drones are not to blame. They say the situation is
      the result of an accident caused by human error.

      - Russia''s friends in the Afghan Taliban have disconnected their country from
      the Internet. As a result, banking systems, airports, communication channels
      and other services have collapsed.

      - Former British Defence Secretary Wallace said that the way to make Crimea
      uninhabitable was to supply Ukraine with missiles and have the Kerch Bridge
      bombed to pieces.

      - In an overnight air raid, the Russians killed a family of four in one of the
      hit apartment buildings near Krasnopil: the parents and their two children,
      aged 6 and 4.

      - Heavy rains flooded parts of Odessa. A young girl is missing after being swept
      away by the current. The floods have already claimed 9 victims, including one
      child.

      - Russia criticises the conduct of the elections in Moldova. The Kremlin says
      the elections were fraudulent and resembled a dictatorship.

      - Romania and Ukraine plan to jointly produce drones to protect NATO''s eastern
      borders.

      - Ukraine receives €4 billion in macroeconomic financial assistance from the
      EU.

    desc: 'Russia''s bet on Moldova has gone horribly wrong. The party of the current
      President even won a majority of the votes, which means a gain of 55 seats in
      the parliament, and it enjoyed relatively strong support not only at home but
      also in occupied Transnistria, even from voters in Russia and Belarus. In total,
      the pro-Western parties won around 70% of the vote, while the pro-Russian parties
      won around 25%. Russia''s debacle was underlined by the ''mega-protests'' that
      the pro-Russian parties called for after the results were announced, which attracted
      around three hundred people in the capital, which did not prevent opposition
      leader Dodon from declaring himself the winner, accusing Moldovans voting abroad
      of a national tragedy and announcing that he would seek to annul the elections.
      I send my congratulations to Moldova and keep my fingers crossed that we will
      follow the same path this weekend. But now for more [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02yLYs6UmQWE1N2uBjvp7hJyMxeMvkVhDJheGWBvjE3LeDcMFFQzRTj6ZGBx9tioKAl):

    detail: "- Polish investigators have confirmed that none of the Russian drones\
      \ that flew into Poland carried an explosive warhead or other explosives. Instead,\
      \ the drones were equipped with additional fuel tanks to extend their range.\
      \ Poland has therefore again categorically ruled out the possibility that the\
      \ drones were over Poland by mistake.\n- After a long series of pro-Russian\
      \ statements, JD Vance made a televised appeal to the Russians themselves, telling\
      \ them that their soldiers are dying daily in Ukraine without any tangible results.\
      \ He said the Russians should \"wake up and face reality\".\n- The Polish embassy\
      \ building was damaged during yesterday's air strike on Kiev. The Foreign Ministry\
      \ reported that \"a grenade of a smaller calibre\" pierced the roof of the embassy\
      \ and landed in one of the kitchens. Fortunately, no one was injured.\n- Russia\
      \ sent troops to the Sumy region to try to cross the water reservoir at Kondrativka\
      \ in small, single-seater inflatable boats. Ukrainian drones made sure that\
      \ no one got to the opposite bank.\n- Another night, another sighting of unknown\
      \ drones over strategic locations in Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Denmark closed\
      \ its skies to all civilian drones from today to Friday in response to the incidents.\n\
      - When asked if the United States had allowed Ukraine to hit targets in Russia\
      \ with U.S. weapons, Kellogg replied that there is no such thing as a safe haven\
      \ when it comes to military targets in Russia.\n- Zelensky urged the West to\
      \ consider closing the Baltic Sea to all Russian ships because of repeated sabotage,\
      \ movements of ships from the so-called shadow fleet, drone incidents and other\
      \ provocations.\n- At least 3,000 civilians have already been injured (and often\
      \ killed) in the Russian \"safari\" in Kherson. Many of the victims are senior\
      \ citizens who have no chance to escape the drones.\n- In Bryansk, an industrial\
      \ site of Elektrodetal, which produces electrical connectors for military use,\
      \ among other things, was hit by a Ukrainian Neptune missile.\n- Residents of\
      \ Sevastopol are now allowed to fill up with a maximum of 30 litres of petrol\
      \ per purchase. The problem is that many petrol stations do not even have 30\
      \ litres of petrol.\n- According to the Polish foreign minister, Trump started\
      \ supporting Ukraine purely because he was familiar with the situation, and\
      \ he would not tolerate being on the losing side.\n- Germany has moved its frigate\
      \ FGS Hamburg to the port of Copenhagen to strengthen its Baltic Sea defences.\
      \  \n- A Syrian official confirmed that several Russian troops were surrounded\
      \ near the village of Dobropillja.\n- Putin signed a decree on autumn conscription.\
      \ It affects some 135,000 men.\n- The Ukrainian army shot down a Russian Mi-8\
      \ helicopter with infantry using an FPV drone today.\n"

    desc: 'Czech authorities, primarily the Center for Online Risk Research, are currently
      investigating a network of hundreds of fake TikTok accounts that spread anti-government
      and especially pro-Russian narratives ahead of the upcoming elections. They
      use content generated by artificial intelligence, have a combined number of
      millions of views and - unsurprisingly - primarily support anti-system parties
      that themselves spread Russian propaganda in our country: Enough!, SPD and PRO.
      But this is not news. Russia has successfully repeated the same tactics in many
      elections around the world, installing pro-Russian governments and local governments
      (e.g. East Germany, Hungary, Slovakia...) and influencing politics to the detriment
      of the citizens themselves (Brexit). In the United States, Russia has twice
      won elections for Donald Trump, and here in the Czech Republic, it caters to
      the massive reach of anti-system parties and personalities, which then rival
      even the world''s biggest personalities on the same networks in terms of reactions
      and views. Social networks have become the modern pub, square, television and
      living room, yet the state does not protect them in the same way as the real
      ones. And explain this to legislators when the average age of MPs is around
      45 and even 55 or more for senators. But now for some [news from the East](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid026x5zNcnBeuRTw5NQVpLkjLwuraaVY2b2M3njijKeQPs78EHgVEKxM12W97NjNHXSl):

    title: Sunday
    detail: '- Parliamentary elections are held in Moldova. According to the current
      President, Sandu, Russia is trying to take control of the parliament and make
      the country a forward base for attacks and sabotage in Europe. A court has banned
      the candidates of two pro-Russian parties ahead of the elections. The leader
      of one of them lives in Moscow, while the leader of the other is on numerous
      Western sanctions lists because of her ties to Russia. Once again, the elections
      are accompanied by classic Russian shenanigans: some consulates in the West,
      where some of the diaspora vote, have had to be closed because of bomb threats.
      On the other hand, in the East - in Russia and Belarus - pro-Russian parties
      are organising buses to take people to polling stations, which is illegal under
      Moldovan law. It has also been reported that Moldova has closed bridges with
      the pro-Russian enclave in Transnistria.

      - Russia sent 595 reconnaissance and kamikaze drones to Ukraine overnight, as
      well as 48 missiles or cruise missiles. Ukrainian air defence forces managed
      to shoot down a total of 611 objects. The primary targets were the Kiev region
      and the capital Kiev, which reported at least 4 dead after the airstrike, including
      a 12-year-old girl. One of the apartment blocks in the town of Petropavlivska-Borshchahivka
      virtually ceased to exist after the airstrike. The Kiev Cardiology Institute
      was also hit, where one of the patients and his nurse were killed. In total,
      Ukraine reports around 70 wounded.

      - Hungary''s Deputy Foreign Minister Levente Magyar tried to school Ukraine
      yesterday by reminding them that Hungary "gave up two-thirds of its territory
      for the sake of peace" after World War I, and suggested that Ukraine should
      now consider giving up a fifth of its territory. For the record, Hungary, or
      rather Austria-Hungary, was the aggressor in the First World War, and the loss
      of territory was thus a de facto punishment for starting the war.

      - Leaked information from Russian channels revealed that on August 7, the Russian
      military ship Vyshnyi Volozhyok (Project 21631, Buyan-M class, carrying Kalibr
      missiles) collided with the civilian tanker Nazan in the Temryuk Bay of the
      Azov Sea while trying to evade Ukrainian naval drones. The collision damaged
      the hulls of both vessels.

      - Ukraine completely closed Kupyansk to civilians, including firefighters or
      rescue workers, because of the Russian advance. Only military personnel are
      now allowed in the city. Residents are urged to evacuate immediately on foot
      to checkpoints outside the town where teams made up of police and volunteers
      are waiting.

      - A Ukrainian airstrike today hit a heating plant and electricity substation
      in Belgorod, Russia, causing a power outage in at least part of the city. Somewhat
      ironically, diesel and petrol generators are being used to provide temporary
      power. But at least gasoline is currently almost non-existent in Belgorod.

      - Russia, together with the United States, is planning another foreign ministerial
      meeting during the autumn. It is said to serve the purpose of "removing obstacles
      in mutual relations".

      - Lavrov lied again when he said, "Arabic is not banned in Israel, Hebrew is
      not banned in Arab countries and Iran. But Russian is banned in Ukraine."

      - Sweden and Finland have deployed an assault brigade on the border with Russia.

    desc: 'Russian propaganda claims that Ukraine is planning a provocation in which
      it will use repaired - originally crashed - Russian kamikaze drones and send
      them over Romania or Poland to draw NATO into the war. In fact, the Russians
      always release such reports when they need to create an alibi for their own
      actions in advance. One can therefore suspect that the Russians are preparing
      another provocation in a NATO country - similar to the one they sent their drones

      - Russia paid priests from the Moldovan Orthodox Church to help spread Russian

      Vladimir Plahotniuc, who is estimated to have deprived Moldova of up to 12%
      of its GDP in the so-called "theft of the century", returned to Moldova today.
      In handcuffs. Plahotniuc, who for years was considered one of the most powerful
      businessmen in the country, fled the country in 2019 to escape prosecution that
      accused him of a large-scale embezzlement of funds from the banking sector,
      including for the benefit of another pro-Russian oligarch - Ilan Șor. Meanwhile,
      his links to Russia and his attempts to destabilise Moldova have landed him
      on the sanctions lists of both the United States and the European Union. In
      July this year, Plahotniuc was arrested in Greece, where he was hiding, at Moldova''s
      request, and his extradition took place today. It almost seems that the Eastern

    detail: "- During the attacks on the village of Shandryholove near Donetsk, the\
      \ Russians stormed a house, shot a couple and used their minor daughter as a\
      \ human shield against Ukrainian drones. Moreover, intercepts of Russian radios\
      \ show that this was not an impulsive decision, but that the soldiers were acting\
      \ on the direct orders of their commander, who had ordered all civilians to\
      \ be shot. It is worth remembering that only those inhabitants who wanted to\
      \ live under Russian occupation remained in the frontline villages. But Russia\
      \ kills everyone indiscriminately.\n- Today, around midday, the Ukrainians attacked\
      \ the Russian port of Novorossiysk with air and naval drones. The Russians claim\
      \ to have disabled at least five naval drones. So far, there is no known damage\
      \ caused by the naval drones. But the videos show that the flying drones were\
      \ more successful by a whisker. They damaged infrastructure in the port and\
      \ debris from the downed drones caused fires across the city. The local oil\
      \ pipeline was also allegedly damaged.\n- According to Gubarev, former governor\
      \ of the occupation administration of the \"Donetsk People's Republic\", Russia\
      \ is losing the war with Ukraine. According to him, Russia is making slight\
      \ advances during the offensive, but at the cost of huge losses, a situation\
      \ that suits Ukraine. At the same time, he says, Ukraine is bent on causing\
      \ the collapse of Russia's energy sector and economy with its attacks on refineries.\n\
      - Former US Florida police officer John Mark Dougan fled to Moscow in 2016 to\
      \ escape prosecution, was granted political asylum, and - it is now coming to\
      \ light - is actively working with the Russian GRU to develop and use AI models\
      \ to run \"troll farms\" creating fake news sites spreading Russian propaganda\

      \ all military means to defend against and deter enemies, for example shooting\
      \ down Russian drones as well as fighter jets that violate the alliance's airspace.\n\
      - According to Zaluzhny, the cost of the Ukrainian foray into the Kursk region\
      \ was too high. But proponents argue that it deprived Russia of the initiative\
      \ and delayed its own offensive for several months.\n- The Ukrainians cleared\
      \ the village of Novotoretske, north of Pokrovsk, of Russians. This continues\
      \ to cut off Russian reinforcements and supplies to the town of Dobropillya.\n\
      - The Ukrainians hit the Russian training site of Molkino near Krasnodar and\
      \ destroyed several Iskander missile launchers as well as one Pancir-S1 air\

    desc: 'What are the tactics that the Russian military is currently employing on
      most fronts? Small assault formations on ATVs or motorcycles. The vast majority
      of soldiers will not reach their destination because they will be destroyed
      by mines or FPV drones along the way. And if someone does survive, commanders
      scrutinize their route to send another unit after the same. This is not a regular
      military tactic, but a pure lottery with human lives. In short, Russia. And
      this is also what is happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0RQnBwgLtGTJjZZg6t7rSHx7TDqKoygEFURN1hm2NMESodNWEmb3o81xNnRRgR22Gl):

    detail: '- Afghanistan has rejected Trump''s demands that it return control of
      Bagram airbase to US forces. The Taliban even let it be known that they would
      be happy to fight the Americans for the next 20 years rather than hand over
      the bases without a fight. Trump, in return, threatens the Taliban that he will
      deal with evil if they refuse the Americans.

      - According to Ukrainian foreign intelligence, the end of the war will mean
      the collapse of the Russian economy. Indeed, it is currently stimulated only
      by massive production in the military-industrial sector. But all other sectors
      have shrunk and growth has stalled.

      - The U.S. Department of Defense has informed accredited media that it now has
      to pre-approve with the Pentagon any information it plans to publish, including
      that which is not classified.

      - Analysts at Bloomberg believe that Putin, after the Alaska summit, became
      convinced that the United States would not intervene in any way in the war in
      Ukraine, and therefore stepped up airstrikes and added other provocations.

      - Russian General Lapin, former commander of the North and Central military
      districts, has been "retired" from the Russian army. He will now serve as an
      assistant to Tatarstan''s head of military affairs, Rustam Minnikhanov.

      - The Ukrainian army reports that the personnel situation in the forces is better
      now than it was six months ago, but it still lacks the troops to take Ukraine
      on the offensive.

      - Ukrainian forces have advanced and conducted a tactical encirclement of Russian
      troops in Oleksiivka in the occupied part of the Sumy region.

      - Ukrainian FPV drones destroyed three Russian Mi-8 helicopters in occupied
      Crimea as well as a 55Zh6U Nebo-U radar.

      - Petr Pavel proposes that NATO shoot down Russian drones violating Alliance
      airspace.

      - Zelensky meets with Trump during the UN General Assembly in New York.

      - Ukraine''s military will create a new separate branch of the army: the Assault
      Forces.

      - Polish authorities have discovered the probable wreckage of the last of the
      Russian drones.

      - Trump claimed to have prevented conflict between Armenia and Cambodia.

      - The UN Security Council will meet tomorrow at the request of Estonia.

    detail: '- Ukrainian media have reported videos of an operation during which a
      projectile was removed from the heart of one of the Ukrainian Azovstal defenders.
      What makes the story even more incredible is the fact that the soldier spent
      three years in Russian captivity with the projectile in his heart muscle because
      the Russians refused to operate on him.

      - Mining giant Exxon Mobil has announced that it has no plans to participate

      of Crimea.

      - According to Ukraine''s defence minister, Ukraine will soon be able to deploy

    detail: '- China held three hours of talks with Poland, trying to persuade it
      to reopen its border with Belarus, through which a significant volume of Chinese
      goods flows. But Poland rejected the request, telling the Chinese that "destructive
      actions by Moscow and Minsk" were behind the border closure and advising them
      that China should rather pressure Russia and Belarus.

      - There are more men than women in the Chinese population, the opposite is true
      in the Russian population because of the war with Ukraine. Russian MPs are therefore
      concerned that the introduction of a visa-free regime with China will lead to
      an influx of Chinese men into Russia looking for wives.

      - Poland has detained two people who were flying a drone over the presidential
      residence in Warsaw. They were one Belarusian and one Ukrainian. The President''s
      security team shot down the drone before detaining the two men.

      - In the morning, the Russians sent a missile at the building housing the pharmaceutical
      institute of the University of Kharkiv. But according to Russian propaganda,
      it was a "base for foreign mercenaries". At least 4 people were injured in the
      airstrike.

      - Today the Russians bombed the logistics warehouses of the Ukrainian e-shop
      Episentr in the Kiev region. A large fire subsequently broke out at the site,

      direction of Pokrovsk has virtually collapsed. Meanwhile, other Russian formations

      - The Russians attempted to infiltrate Jampil near Donetsk disguised as civilians.
      They used real civilians as human shields.

      with small arms to hunt down long-range drones.

      - The United States hit another ship off the coast of Venezuela, killing its

      the Zapad-2025 military maneuvers in Belarus.

      units lost significant territory in the fighting.

      - Estonia has closed airspace near its border with Russia to all civilian flights
      because of the drone threat.

      - At the front, a 24-year-old Canadian volunteer, Patrick Mazerolle, died after

    detail: '- The conservative scene is trying to create an equivalence between the
      murder of a Ukrainian asylum seeker on the subway and the shooting of the Utah
      klerofascist Kirk, with the generous support of Russian propaganda channels.
      Kirk himself was an active disseminator of Russian propaganda, describing Zelensky
      as the murderer of a million people, claiming that Ukraine was to blame for
      the war, supporting Russia''s annexation of Crimea and the deportation of refugees
      back to Ukraine. Troll farms and the usual Russian propaganda personalities
      have also been calling on the American public to start a civil war for days
      now.

      - Poland has repeatedly said that there is no doubt who was behind the drones
      that infiltrated Poland: Russia. According to Polish officials, it was Russia''s
      way of testing NATO''s response without starting a full-scale war. After all,
      Russia does not deny that the drones were its. This is where the official version
      differs from the Russian propaganda, which tries to cast doubt on the origin
      of the drones and cover them up in every possible way, and which is then spread
      by Russian propaganda ''influencers'' in Western countries.

      - Trump has admitted for the first time that he has failed in his peace efforts
      around Russia and Ukraine. At the same time, he openly branded Russia as the
      aggressor and criticised Europe for not being tough enough on Russia. China,
      however, has threatened the West with a "decisive response" if NATO countries,
      under pressure from Trump, impose secondary tariffs on Chinese exports because
      of its purchases of Russian oil.

      - The Ukrainians captured the rest of the Russian assault group that infiltrated
      Kupyansk through a former gas pipeline. Under interrogation, the captured soldiers
      testified that orders from the Russian command included breaking into nearby
      civilian homes, killing all adult males in the homes, and using women and children
      as human shields against Ukrainian attempts to clear the homes of Russian troops.

      - According to Kellogg, if Russia were winning, its army would be in Kiev, Odessa,
      or at least west of Dnipro today, overthrowing the Ukrainian government. But
      none of that has happened to date, which he says is clear evidence that Russia
      is losing the war.

      - A Ukrainian air strike hit a Russian radar station near Rostov and completely
      destroyed the RLK-1 radar complex there - part of the air traffic control.

      - Poland''s president signed a resolution allowing troops from NATO countries
      to enter Polish territory to defend the alliance''s eastern borders.

      - Ukrainian troops report a complete internet blackout from Starlink on the
      entire front. The company says it is a global outage.

      - Russia has produced over 30,000 Shahed kamikaze drones this year and plans
      to double production next year.

      - The Czech Republic has sent three military helicopters to Poland to help protect
      against Russian drones.

      movement. But the Ukrainians report that they have already destroyed three of
      the four branches of the pipeline and flooded the pipeline.

      - Russia is reportedly seeking to buy back the S-400 air defense systems it
      sold to Turkey in 2019. And Turkey may nod to the sale because it is under U.S.

      of the systems.

      Poland. In the immediate aftermath of the Russian drone strike, ResFutura analyzed
      comments on the primary social networks (FB, IG, X, YT, TT), looking at who
      the commenters believed was responsible for the drone strike on Poland. Another
      15% blamed the Polish government, 8% the mainstream media and 5% NATO/West.

      - Mukesh Ambani, Indian billionaire and owner of Reliance Industries, is one
      of the key enablers of Russia''s circumvention of Western sanctions. His company
      processes a third of all Russian oil shipped to India, including through entities
      registered in Estonia.

      - US envoy Cole met with Lukashenko. On that occasion, he presented him with
      a letter in which Trump tells Lukashenko that he prays for his robust health.
      After the meeting, Lukashenko ordered the release of 52 political prisoners.

      - Slovak Foreign Minister Blanár said, "I want to believe that the drones that
      penetrated Polish territory were drones that did not go there to attack Poland,
      but were meant to end up on Ukrainian territory."

      - Former Ukrainian President Yanukovych lost a court case he had with the European
      Union over the sanctions, so the sanctions remain in place, as does his ban
      on entering Schengen territory.

      - An officer in the Chechen Akhmat forces made a video claiming that Russia
      is far behind Ukraine in the production and use of combat drones.

      - The U.S. House of Representatives approved an $890 billion defense package,
      $400 million of which is to fund aid to Ukraine.

      - The Ukrainians captured a Russian soldier who shot dead his two commanders,
      blew up the trenches he was supposed to hold, and came himself to surrender
      to the Ukrainians.

      - In the occupied territories, Russia has begun to view Ukrainians who have
      not collected Russian passports as foreigners and has threatened them with deportation.

      - One of the Russian Gerbera drones crashed into a military compound in the
      village of Pilica after entering Polish airspace yesterday.

      - In Utah, USA, ultra-conservative activist and disseminator of Russian propaganda
      Charlie Kirk was shot dead yesterday.

      Shahed kamikaze drones.

      - The Russians damaged the building of the Cathedral of the Resurrection in
      Sumy during an overnight raid on Ukraine.

      - The Ukrainian army purchased more than 1,000 new Novator infantry vehicles.

      - The UN Security Council meets over Russian drones over Poland.

    desc: 'Confirmed losses of military equipment in the Pokrov sector alone already
      exceed those of entire armies in most wars of the second half of the 20th century.
      Russia, for example, lost 732 tanks or 1,532 armoured vehicles. Meanwhile, Russian
      and Ukrainian losses maintain a roughly 4-5:1 ratio in favour of Ukraine. But
      the fiercest fighting is probably yet to come. Ukraine reports that Russia has
      moved another 150,000 troops into the sector. A total of 5 naval and paratroop
      brigades are moving from the Sumy front to do so, the 156th ground infantry
      brigade, which has recently turned into a mechanised unit, a motorised artillery
      division from Kherson is also going to help them, and several tank regiments
      are to support the whole offensive. Thus, 9 whole armies are regrouping near
      Pokrovsk at the moment, while so far there have been 7-8 in the vicinity of
      the city. The fall of Pokrovsk would open the way for the Russians to gradually
      occupy the rest of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

      Special forces boarded the Scanlark cargo ship and discovered a variety of spy
      equipment. In addition, the ship is suspected of being the launching point for
      some of the drones that would be spotted over critical German infrastructure.
      The ship flies the St. Vincent flag, is registered in Estonia, but the crew
      is all Russian.

      - The Russians have committed another heinous war crime. Their air force dropped
      a guided bomb on a village square in the village of Jarova, near Donetsk, where
      pensions were being paid to the local population. 25 people, mostly senior citizens,
      were killed. Among the victims were two employees of the post office that provides
      pension payments. Another 19 people were injured.

      - The action in which the Belarusian intelligence network was broken up has
      had an interesting outcome in Romania, where Alexandru Balan, former deputy
      director of the Romanian intelligence service, has been arrested. The investigation
      revealed that he was a senior agent of the Belarusian KGB.

      - For a fee, Russia recruits people in Ukraine on Telegram to deploy GPS locators
      around potential targets, which then help guide drones and missiles.

      - Russia named a school in occupied Donetsk after Michael Gloss, the son of
      the US CIA director who was killed in Ukraine while fighting in Russian ranks.

      - Occupier Alexei "Chuma" Chumachenko, 32, raped and then killed a nine-year-old
      girl in the village of Olchatovka in the occupied Donetsk region.

      - 415 drones and 43 cruise missiles/rockets were flown into Ukraine overnight.
      The target was infrastructure in western and southern Ukraine.

      - Belarus is building new bases in the south of the country, reportedly to host
      Russian Oreshnik missile systems.

      - Poland is also expelling a Belarusian ''diplomat'' in light of the latest
      spy case.

    desc: 'Russian kamikaze drones no longer threaten only Ukraine. Reportedly, as
      many as 19 (some sources say as many as 23) drones flew into Polish airspace
      during a night raid on Ukraine. And this time Poland could not stand by passively.
      Polish air defences as well as Dutch F-35 fighter jets intervened against the
      drones and together shot down at least eight of them. One of the drones flew
      330 km through Polish airspace and its wreckage landed 200 km from the Czech
      border. Poland''s president called an emergency cabinet meeting over the incident,
      and Poland later announced that it would use Article 4 of the North Atlantic
      Treaty Organisation to negotiate a strengthening of its eastern border defences.
      In any case, the Kremlin announced that the claim that the drones over Poland
      were Russian was not supported by any evidence. And this narrative was immediately
      taken up by Russian influencers: not only Robert Fico, but also, for example,
      Kateryna Konecna, demanding an investigation into who "controlled the drones
      over Poland", supposedly to rule out provocations. Experts, however, have no
      doubt about the origin of the drones - after all, Ukraine has been monitoring
      their flight all along. But they add that Russia has probably decided to use
      its ongoing Zapad-2025 manoeuvres to test NATO''s readiness for a potential
      conflict. Europe''s security will therefore depend to a large extent on its
      response to this incident. And here are more [reports](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid038JAHAfATrcRyNhY97nXG62km84vjGtrqmr44owLexe5J1SRa14FdjCqXL6CezVbal):

      Russia and Russian-occupied areas, even Moscow and St Petersburg. Gasoline is
      either scarce or completely lacking. And where there is still petrol at the
      pumps, its price has jumped to 90 roubles per litre, with dealers selling it
      for as much as 200 roubles. In some Russian regions, a full tank of gas can
      cost up to half the average Russian wage.

      - In July, the SBU uncovered a "mole" in the Ukrainian anti-corruption organisation
      NABU. The detainee was also a member of the FSB and handed over more than 60
      volumes of classified information to the former bodyguard of fugitive President
      Yanukovych. He faces up to 15 years in prison for treason. His network also
      included SBU Major General Valery Shaytanov, who has since been sentenced to
      12 years in prison.

      - All the major figures of Russian propaganda in the US are now outraged over
      the recent murder of a young Ukrainian woman on the subway in Charlotte, NC.
      Not because they care about the life of a Ukrainian woman. They are merely exploiting
      the incident for their usual spread of racial hatred because the perpetrator
      was black.

      - The investigation revealed that the Ukrainian parliament building was not
      actually hit by a drone, but by an Iskander missile. However, its warhead failed,
      so all the initial damage was caused by the kinetic energy of the rocket and
      the subsequent fire was caused by the burning remains of the rocket fuel.

      - Russian soldiers are doing exactly what Russian propaganda accuses the Ukrainians
      of doing: stealing weapons and ammunition on a large scale and selling them
      on the black market. The Russian Investigative Project has recorded a 300% increase
      in arms smuggling cases from Russia in the last two years.

      - Russian media claim that 200,000 people, mostly men and teenagers, left Ukraine
      from September 6 to 7. This is almost certainly a fabrication, but you will
      soon see this report on all disinformation channels.

      was killed. His body was discovered under a bridge, decapitated, tied with a
      tow rope.

      it had dismantled the intelligence network that the Belarusian intelligence

      - Zelensky said that one-fifth of all Russian drones are now shot down by Ukrainian
      drone-interceptors.

    desc: 'Irina Yarovaya, a member of the Russian State Duma from Putin''s United
      Russia party, said in a television interview that Russian, as a language, is
      most destined to be a language of dialogue and friendship. "There are words
      in Russian like in no other language. It has deep emotional and moral meanings
      that reflect the Russian national character, which in turn reflects grace, kindness,
      perseverance, self-sacrifice and sincerity," she added. In our Central European
      optics, of course, this is a bundle of incredible bullshit and self-delusion
      that is quite typical of Putin''s Russia, which raves about its own greatness
      and positive role in the course of history. But Irina is right about one thing.
      Russian has many unique words. For example, "snokhachstvo". This beautiful word
      means "sexual intercourse between the head of a family and his daughter-in-law
      in the son''s absence". Russia, in short, is a great virtue. Except not at all.

      flew into Ukraine last night. The record was also set by the air defense, which
      managed to destroy 747 drones and 4 cruise missiles/rockets. Sadly, a young
      mother and her two-month-old baby were still killed in an airstrike in Kiev.
      In total, four people were killed and at least 44 injured, including three horses
      at a Kiev riding club. For the first time since the beginning of the war, the
      Ukrainian government building, specifically the seat of the Cabinet of Ministers,
      was also hit. In addition, one of the drones strayed into Poland and fell to
      the ground 50 km from the Ukrainian border. Western leaders have traditionally
      condemned the attack. But this time, Zelensky told them that their indignant

    detail: '- In Georgia, protests against the current pro-Russian government have
      flared up again after the ruling Georgian Dream party presented a 470-page report
      that de facto blames Georgia for the 2008 Russo-Georgian war. Opposition parties
      say the government wants to use the report to ban or otherwise crack down on
      some opposition platforms altogether.

      - The killer of Ukrainian politician Parubiya has confessed to the crime, but
      denied that he was blackmailed in any way by Russian intelligence services.
      He said his goal was to get into prison and be exchanged for a Ukrainian prisoner
      of war so that he could get to Russia and try to find the body of his son who
      died in the war.

      - Russia sent a total of 502 drones, 16 Kalibr missiles and 8 Ch-101 missiles
      to Ukraine last night. Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 430 drones and
      21 missiles. One person died and 35 were injured in the airstrike. The targets
      were installations in western Ukraine as well as Kropyvnytskyy.

      - Putin signed 22 agreements with China during his visit to Beijing. But analysts
      say he didn''t get what he wanted most: for the UnionPay system to return to
      Russia and, in turn, for the Mir payment system to return to China, key elements
      that help Russia circumvent Western sanctions.

      - Trump commented on an incident in which the Russians jammed the GPS navigation
      of a plane with Ursula von der Leyen on board: "This way, nobody knows where
      the jamming came from, but it took away her ability to use her cell phone, which
      is sometimes a good thing."

      - In Kostyantynivka, the last hospital there had to shut down due to constant
      Russian shelling. The civilian population lost its only access to health care.

      - Trump confirmed that he had called Putin last week and said that Putin had
      "told him some interesting things that will be of interest to people in the
      coming days."

      - Lavrov said the only way to lasting peace is for the international community
      to recognize Russia''s claim to the occupied areas of Ukraine.

      - Putin said the participation of North Korean soldiers in the fighting in the
      Kursk region was "part of the fight against neo-Nazism."

      - A large oil spill is approaching the coast of Crimea. Oil is reported to have
      leaked from the Caspian Pipeline Consortium pipeline.

      - President Zelensky arrived in Denmark for a security summit of Ukraine, the
      Baltic and Nordic states.

      - Sweden''s Gotland was completely without electricity for the second time.
      The cause is still unknown.

      - Overnight, the Ukrainians put the railway infrastructure at Kuteynikovo station
      near Rostov out of service.

      - In a poll, 6 out of 10 Russians said they are more proud of their country
      now than a year ago.

      - Ukrainians hit a Russian radar base in Anapa last night.

      showcase its advanced weapons, including powerful lasers against flying targets
      and DF-5C missiles capable of nuclear strikes anywhere in the world. Then, in
      its usual totalitarian schizophrenia, it ended the parade by releasing 80,000
      doves of peace. Trump commented on the parade on Truth Social with a message
      to the Chinese president, "Please give Putin and Kim Jong-un my warmest regards
      as you plot against the United States." I guess he was upset that he wasn''t

      attempts by the Russians since 2014, especially for his role in the events surrounding
      the Maidan. In one case, the Russians even tried to kill him with a grenade.
      According to Ukrainian politician Herashchenko, the Russians had lists of politicians
      and other public figures to be liquidated long before the invasion itself.

      - On September 1, Ukraine celebrates the "Day of Knowledge". On that occasion,
      I note that since 2022, the Russians have destroyed or damaged 1 922 primary
      schools, 1 403 kindergartens, 204 leisure-time educational institutions, 106
      vocational training schools, 174 colleges, 126 buildings of Ukrainian universities
      and 36 specialised academic departments.

      - Trump has not appeared in public since August 26, triggering a wave of speculation
      about his health. Trump''s team tried to refute the speculation by posting photos
      of Trump playing golf. But they are all weeks and months old.

      - On July 18 this year, the French health ministry sent letters to hospitals
      instructing them to prepare a plan for how to treat thousands of wounded if
      war breaks out in Europe.

      - Russia''s Gazprom and Chinese energy giant CNPC have signed a memorandum on

      to China from Yamal via the territory of Mongolia.

      - A drunken asylum seeker from Iraq pushed a 16-year-old refugee from Mariupol
      under a moving train in Friedland. She died on the spot. The perpetrator had
      been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in the past.

      - Russian state media broadcast a video of former pro-Russian President of Ukraine
      Yanukovych parroting Russian propaganda reasons for invading Ukraine.

      - Saudi Arabia and Iraq have stopped supplying crude oil to India''s Nayara
      Energy refinery, operated by Russia''s Rosneft, due to fears of European sanctions.

      - An elderly couple died in the Sumy region after their motorbike and sidecar
      hit a mine, probably planted remotely by the Russian army.

      - NATO has created a new command post, the Multi-Corps Land Component Command

    desc: 'Igor "Strelkov" Girkin writes from prison, "It''s a disgrace. This summer
      we have not been able to make a breakthrough on even one section of the front.
      We spent 16 months attacking Khasiv Yar and the result is zero. Meanwhile, Ukraine
      has allowed young people to travel abroad. If Ukraine were really on its last
      campaign, it would have been calling up 16-year-olds to arms by now, but things
      are clearly going well for them." In any case, the reality is not so optimistic.
      Although the Russian advance through Ukraine slowed by almost a fifth during
      August, the Russians still managed to occupy 464 square kilometres of Ukrainian
      territory. Russia is now moving substantial reinforcements from the Sumy and
      Kherson regions to Pokrovsk, where the Russians have managed to penetrate the
      city from the south and will therefore try to make the most of the penetration.
      Analysts also warn that the Russians are massing forces for a major assault
      towards Siversk. But Girkin is right about something: Russian expectations of
      the summer offensive were high. And their expectations have been far from fulfilled.

      - Norway has abandoned plans to buy US frigates and will instead buy Type-26
      warships from Britain for an estimated $13.5 billion. There is speculation that
      after the Americans showed in Ukraine that they can shut down critical functions
      remotely, Norway has lost confidence in American technology.

      - At the meeting in China, Putin again lied to the Indian prime minister that
      "the war in Ukraine is the result of a Western orchestrated coup" and "the need
      for Russia to intervene to protect those who have not accepted the outcome of
      the coup."

      - The Russians have reportedly changed tactics due to a lack of heavy equipment
      and well-trained infantry, and are now primarily focused on searching for and
      destroying Ukrainian artillery or drone positions behind the line of contact.

      - An OSKB exercise has begun in Belarus, involving some 2 000 troops from Belarus,
      Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, as well as some 450 pieces of

      - Ursula von der Leyen''s plane had to land in Bulgaria using paper maps because
      the GPS/GNSS signal around the airport was completely jammed for almost an hour
      at a time. The authorities suspect Russia.

      - Tonight, the Estlink 1 undersea cable between Finland and Estonia lost voltage.

    desc: 'Russians are not yet very interested in the new government-controlled social
      app Max from the "Russian Facebook" vKontakte, so the authorities are working
      tooth and nail to ensure that as many Russians as possible install it. In some
      smaller towns, for example, councillors periodically broadcast calls from the
      municipal radio station to download the app. The government has also paid dozens
      of influencers to tout the app to young audiences. But even that was probably
      not enough, as the Russian government took a radical step in June: Starting
      September 1, today, the Max app must be pre-installed on every phone and tablet
      sold in Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine. Critics inside and outside
      Russia have called Max a "digital gulag". In developing it, Russia was likely
      inspired by similar government apps in China. The primary purpose of the app
      is similar to Meta''s Messenger. However, it contains expanded functionality
      and in the future it is intended to become a similar "superapp" to China''s
      WeChat (and what Musk planned to create from his "X") - offering bank account
      and payment management, communication with authorities, etc., all under the
      microscope of Russian intelligence and censorship authorities. Its publisher
      is VK, which owns all the major Russian social networks: vKontakte, Odnoklassniki
      and Moj Mir, as well as the Mail.ru email service, the Agent app, various online
      and mobile gaming platforms, search engines, cloud services and so on. Virtually
      every Russian already uses at least one of them. Max was used by 2 million Russians

      government-controlled territory. However, the Russians did not keep their word
      and instead shot up the column of retreating soldiers with heavy artillery in
      a pre-targeted corridor. 366 soldiers were killed on the spot, four hundred
      were wounded and another three hundred were captured by the Russians after the
      massacre. It is one of the many reasons why Ukrainians today don''t trust a

      \ Simferopol. This is the first time the Russians have ever used such a weapon\
      \ in a live deployment.\n- China has taken the first of the Russian tankers\

      tendencies in Greenland. According to Denmark, at least three Americans are
      suspected of undertaking subversive activities in Greenland, inciting locals
      to fight for their independence, creating lists of people sympathetic to the
      MAGA movement and collecting materials for a PR campaign. Two others are trying
      to establish relations with local businessmen and politicians. Danish intelligence
      believes this is an attempt to divide Denmark and Greenland for Trump''s political
      ambitions.

      - The United States saw another mass shooting yesterday. A gunman killed 3 people
      and injured 20 others at a Catholic school in Minneapolis. But why is the news

      the shooter had, among other messages on several ammunition magazines, signs
      in Russian written in Cyrillic referring to "memes" from the Russian part of
      the internet. In addition, he was wearing a T-shirt with a patch with the FSB

      - Ukrainian drones again hit two Russian refineries last night - Afipsky near
      Krasnodar and Kuybyshev near Samara. A huge fire broke out in both after the

      Russia of 21% of its total refining capacity in recent weeks.

      - The Russians hit a Ukrainian Laguna-class exploration ship - the Simferopol
      - in the Danube Delta. One sailor was killed, others were injured and several

      - Hungary has imposed sanctions on Ukrainian drone operator "Hungarian" for
      his involvement in drone strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia, which

      building. This could not have been a mistake or a missile diverted off course.
      The death toll is now 18, 4 of whom are children. A building housing the EU

    desc: 'Today''s editorial is going to be rather unpleasant. The media has carried
      the crazy account of 33-year-old Vyacheslav, who was taken prisoner by the Russians
      after the Russians captured his bombed-out position while fighting at the front.
      Russian soldiers subsequently cut his throat and threw him into a rubbish pit,
      believing that the injuries inflicted were incompatible with life. However,
      Vyacheslav survived, managed to treat his wound provisionally with a piece of
      cloth and crawled back to the Ukrainian positions for the next 5 days, where
      his colleagues gave him first aid and managed to evacuate Vyacheslav. The photos
      from the hospital are shocking. It is almost unbelievable how huge a cut wound
      a human body can survive. At the hospital afterwards, he described how his near-death
      was merciful compared to what the Russians did to the intelligence officers
      they had also captured: the Russian soldiers "symbolically" deprived them of
      their eyes, lips, ears, nose and genitals. For context, yesterday the Russian
      Prime Minister signed a decree proposing to cancel the Russian Federation''s
      participation in the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman
      or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. If this is how Russian soldiers treated
      prisoners when the Russian Federation was a signatory to the convention, what
      will captivity look like when the soldiers get a clear signal from the Russian
      Government that they do not have to hold back? Try not to imagine. And check

      captivity: ''The brutality I witnessed... I could never imagine that such things
      still exist in the 21st century. That such people exist. A man tortures you
      all day long and then in the evening he goes home to his family, to his children.
      And the next day it happens again... for a year, two, three. What kind of person
      do you have to be? But for them it''s normal. They don''t feel any inner contradiction,
      they don''t think that it might be wrong or senseless."

      - J.D. Vance claims in a TV interview that Trump forced Russia to make a series
      of concessions. In fact, Russia has conceded on virtually nothing. And even
      if it did soften its outrageous maximum demands, a peace deal from the White
      House''s head would still not mean that Russia would "give up" anything of its
      own, only that it would get less than it is asking for.

      - Because of the threat of a Ukrainian drone attack, a plane carrying Russian
      tourists from Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg had to be diverted to Tallinn,
      Estonia. There, the passengers had to spend nearly six hours on the plane because
      the Estonian authorities forbade them to leave the aircraft.

      away from Ukraine''s borders. Yesterday, the occupied Kuril Islands completely
      stopped the sale of AI-92 gasoline to the civilian population.

      - Pro-Ukrainian hackers broke into the broadcasts of 116 Russian channels and
      broadcast footage of Russian losses, Russia''s political reality, and other
      material to Russian viewers.

      - Polish President Nawrocki vetoed a bill extending financial support and access
      to health care for Ukrainian refugees. The new benefits will apply only to those
      who work.

      - Russians in the occupied territories urged residents to report their neighbors

    desc: 'The Swedish island of Gotland, located in the middle of the Baltic Sea,
      was completely without electricity on Saturday for an unknown reason. The island''s
      underwater connection to the Swedish mainland was reportedly cut. In any case,
      the outage also threatened the drinking water supply, so the authorities warned
      residents to conserve water. The electricity supply was then restored after
      midnight. Just a few days earlier (18 August), a Norwegian fishing boat had
      captured photographs of a Russian minesweeper and a support tug slowly navigating
      in the area where Norway''s undersea cables and pipelines are located. Of course,
      this could be just a coincidental sequence of events, but since Russia has already

      Hungary and that these relations now depend on whose side Hungary takes. In
      response, the Hungarian foreign minister described this as a threat and claimed
      that Hungary had always respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity
      of foreign states.

      - The Ukrainians are launching counter-attacks in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
      Both Zelensky and Syrskyi indicate that they will soon give good news from the
      front. Presumably, they mean the counterattack near the village of Myrne, where
      the Ukrainians are advancing from several directions to encircle the relatively
      large Russian kettle.

      - A helium bottle exploded in a toy shop in a Moscow shopping centre, killing
      one person and seriously injuring three others. It would have been a simple
      tragedy, but one of the severely wounded is Russian FSB officer Alexei Titov.

      - Lavrov now claims that Russia "recognizes Zelensky as the de facto head of
      the current Kiev regime." But it still does not see him as a person who can
      sign a possible peace deal on behalf of Ukraine.

      - It has recently emerged that the Pentagon has been blocking Ukrainian strikes
      with US weapons on targets in Russia for months. Ukraine therefore primarily
      uses its own systems to attack Russia.

      - The Russians ferried a MiG-29 aircraft across the country in Yerevan, Armenia.
      But their anchors failed, and the fighter broke off, crashed nose-first into
      a pole and plunged off an elevated road.

      - In a text for Parlamentní listy, the leader of the Stačilo movement, "Vidlák"
      Sterzik, downplayed the 1968 Russian occupation. According to him, it was the
      only occupation in the world that left the occupied country in a better state

      caused by "a hundred car accidents".

      - South Africa is investigating the Russian recruitment campaign for possible

      waiting to work on the production of Russian kamikaze drones.

      - Zelensky said in a televised speech that Ukraine would in no way trade territory
      for a promise of peace. He also rejected the idea of China becoming one of the

      cannot be a partner for peace.

      produce one a day today, it plans to increase production to seven missiles a
      day, or 210 a month, in the coming months. In addition, the first photographs

      had already announced in advance that Zelensky could end the war if he gave
      up Crimea and NATO membership. At the same time, he ran his usual amok on Truth
      Social, complaining about the opinions of journalists and analysts and telling
      them that he didn''t need their advice because "he''s already ended six different

    desc: 'When US Secretary of State Rubio says that "both sides in the conflict
      will have to make concessions on their demands", he inevitably (and perhaps
      deliberately) bends the public debate in Russia''s favour. Ukraine does not
      have a "conflict" with Russia. Ukraine is defending itself on its territory
      after Russia invaded it with the aim of seizing its territory. And Ukraine has
      only one demand: that the Russians go home. Seeking a "compromise" between Ukraine''s
      desire for freedom and Russia''s genocidal aggression thus necessarily leads
      to Russia only gaining something, while Ukraine only loses something. And such
      international politics is either incredibly naive to the point of stupidity
      or very, very insidious. But now [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0p2NdQuHXN5eYU5Ep5zqn1XYNEL6wNpT42UTKzCozUGdwS1kx5rf9Simi3H141Ruzl):

      and Vesele near the town of Dobropillya, where the Russians had recently managed
      to penetrate behind the Ukrainian line, of Russians. Azov, which also operates
      in the area, reports that in the past 72 hours it has eliminated 271 occupiers,
      knocked 101 out of combat, taken 13 prisoners, and also destroyed 1 tank, 2
      armored vehicles, 37 light vehicles and motorcycles, and 3 field guns.

      - Yesterday''s explosion at the Russian Elastik gunpowder plant was so powerful
      that it practically leveled the entire production hall. At least 11 workers
      died at the site, at least 10 others are still missing. 130 people sustained
      injuries.

      - Norwegian media say Trump recently called Norway''s finance minister and openly
      asked for the Nobel Peace Prize in exchange for not imposing more tariffs on
      Norwegian imports to the US.

      - The cargo ship Port Olya 4, which was hit by Ukrainians while carrying a cargo
      of parts for Shahed drones from Iran, sank near the port of Astrakhan.

      - Japan uncovered a scheme in which participants attempted to circumvent existing
      sanctions and ship Tsugami machine tools to Russia.

      - Lukoil''s refinery near Volgograd, which was recently hit by Ukrainian drones,
      had to stop operations completely.

      - Finland is building complexes of fortified bunkers and underground infantry
      bases on its border with Russia.

      - Just before the Alaska summit, the Russians hit the Sum centre with ballistic
      missiles.

      - Lithuania has announced that it will build several defensive lines along the
      borders with Russia and Belarus.

      - Ukrainian forces report that they have again cleared Pokrovsk of Russian saboteurs.

      - Zelensky will meet with Trump in Washington on Monday.

    desc: 'The Alaska Summit turned out exactly as everyone expected: Putin got a
      huge volume of propaganda material for his PR, while Trump got nothing at all,
      except a photo with Putin and a lot of embarrassing moments for the entire United
      States. And, surprisingly, people across the political spectrum agree, including
      the American conservative-right FOX News, which couldn''t hide its disillusionment
      at how weak Trump was next to the biggest killer of the 21st century. Former
      Republican governor of California and movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger told
      Trump that he "stood next to Putin like a little soggy noodle". According to
      House Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, Trump has provided Putin with legitimacy,
      a global stage and zero accountability without getting anything in return. The
      delegations even canceled a planned joint lunch and press conference (only briefly
      stating their positions without taking questions from reporters). In his statement,
      Putin tried to play on Trump''s ego, telling him that if he had been president
      instead of Biden, the war would certainly not have started. He also cynically
      uttered that Russia considers Ukraine a brotherly nation, and therefore the
      war is a terrible tragedy for Russia (a typical feature of fascism is that it
      claims to be a victim at all costs, even of its own actions). The icing on the
      cake was his wish that Europe, in particular, should not spoil the agreement
      between Russia and America. In any case, Trump called the summit "10 out of
      10" and added that the ball is in Ukraine''s court. Later, Trump then called
      with Zelensky and European leaders and reportedly told them that Putin would
      not agree to a ceasefire because he was demanding a clearly articulated peace
      deal (aka Ukraine''s surrender).

      a symbolic Kiev chicken on board the plane. Lavrov also made headlines immediately
      after stepping off the plane because he showed up wearing a sweatshirt with
      "USSR" (CCCP) written on it. But the biggest losers of the whole charade seem

    desc: 'Both Ukrainian and Russian sources agree that the initial Russian breakthrough

      by fast attack groups on motorcycles, which the Russians planned to supply with
      drone drops. Only the drones can''t reach the Russians, and the Ukrainians have
      reportedly managed to cut off the Russian sortie in its rear, so the Russian
      troops are now scattered at a distance of about 16 km from the nearest Russian
      frontline positions, where the Ukrainians are gradually searching for and destroying
      them. Azov alone reports that it has already eliminated 151 Russian soldiers,
      knocked another 70 out of the fight with no possibility of evacuation, and captured
      8. The first videos are also emerging of desperate Russian soldiers being given
      a drink by Ukrainians after the Russians surrendered to them. According to current
      information, the 132nd Motorized Artillery Brigade of the Russian Army is responsible
      for the "breakthrough". And the whole action looks like it was simply sacrificed
      by the Russian command in an attempt to satisfy Putin and his inner circle.

      at protecting our state, our homeland and the interests of our people. For Trump
      it''s a business, for us it''s a matter of life and death, a matter of destiny.
      Ukraine will either be ours or it will belong to no one and nothing will exist."

      - The Bakhmut Demon channel reported that Azov had liquidated some Russian troops
      who managed to penetrate behind the Ukrainian defense line and also took the
      first Russians prisoner. Thus, stabilisation operations continue in the area,

      not allow these people to help stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment among Poles.

      - Estonia designated the first secretary of the Russian embassy in Tallinn as
      "persona non grata". According to the Estonian authorities, he was involved
      in actions aimed at dismantling the rule of law, sowing division in local society
      and facilitating crimes against the state.

      - A siren recently sounded in the warehouse of the Russian company Ozon, warning
      of a possible drone attack. However, when people evacuated outside and lined
      up at the designated location, military commissars were waiting to give them
      their call-up orders.

      - Ukraine''s military intelligence chief says Operation Spider Web could have
      taken place about a month earlier, but because the Russian drivers hired were
      constantly intoxicated, the whole event had to be postponed several times.

      - According to analysts from Radio Free Europe, 12 air defence systems are now
      protecting Putin''s palace in Valdai.

      - Russian state propaganda threatens Azerbaijan with a "special military operation"
      because of Baku''s rhetoric against Russia.

      - Trump again threatens Russia with tough sanctions if it does not agree to

      they say they want to leave money to their families! Is that good or bad? It''s
      good that they think of their families, but it''s bad that they don''t understand
      that normal guys who are in the same strike group with them can die because
      of them. Evacuation teams are already dying trying to get the wounded out. But
      I have a lot of questions not only for them, but for those who recruit them
      in the first place and assign them not just anywhere, but right to the front
      lines of the attack! So that you can claim to have recruited enough volunteers?"
      If such a person is killed at the front, his family should be compensated by
      the state to the tune of 5 million roubles (CZK 1.31 million). But as we know
      from many other sources, this often does not happen: Commanders report the fallen
      as "missing" or captured, ensuring that the family gets nothing. But I would
      like to use this paragraph mainly to appeal to people who feel that things are
      bad in the Czech Republic and therefore plan to bring the Czech Republic closer
      to Russia in the elections. Some people in Russia are so miserable and have
      such zero prospects in life that they see the only way out of it as getting
      killed in a war they did not even want, with a country that had no influence
      on their misfortune. Compared to them, we are all just spoiled, ungrateful Western
      Europeans who have no appreciation for the unprecedented prosperity and peace
      they live in. And now for some [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0tPC9RuJHLnPKZbFVtWdseWPfstK3mTw7VsCiNitN21wbwigA3Snw2icpx46qz9Ewl):

      them to literally slave away in the Russian construction sector. They described
      to the BBC the 20-hour shifts, the two days off a year or what the Russians
      derisively called "talking machines". According to South Korea, there are around
      10,000 such modern-day "slaves" in Russia.

      - The Moldovan oligarch Ilan Șor, who is currently hiding from justice in Moscow,
      has announced that he intends to occupy the square in front of the Moldovan
      parliament and is offering $3,000 to potential participants in such a protest.

      - The New York Times reports that on 21 July, some fifteen fresh foreign volunteers
      from the US, Taiwan, Denmark and Colombia were killed in Ukraine when a Russian
      missile landed on the mess hall of a training camp.

      - Russian propaganda on TikTok circulated a video showing a robotic food courier
      to show how advanced Russia is. But the video comes from Finland. There is no
      such service in Russia.

      - Ukrainian drones attacked the Russian synthetic sapphire plant JSC Monocrystal
      near Stavropol. A helium plant in Orenburg was also hit.

      - A Russian court sent 54-year-old Ukrainian woman Olena Ipatova to prison for
      5 years for "terrorism" for briefly serving in the Ukrainian army as a medic
      in 2018.

      - A severe fire broke out at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, presumably in the port area.
      Effective firefighting was hampered by the fact that the Russians mined the
      entire coastline.

      - 26 EU leaders signed a joint statement in support of Ukraine directed to Trump.
      Only Viktor Orbán did not join.

      - The Finnish authorities have officially accused the crew of the Russian tanker
      Eagle S of sabotaging underwater infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.

      - China has announced that it is cutting off all contact with President Paul
      over his meeting with the Dalai Lama in India.

      - Russia and Brazil signed an agreement on mutual economic cooperation in response
      to Trump''s threatened tariffs.

      - The Russian government plans an emergency meeting with oil company representatives
      over rising fuel prices.

      - A Russian airstrike on a Ukrainian training ground killed one soldier and
      injured 11 others.

      - Ukrainian drones again hit Russia''s Shahed drone manufacturing plant in Tatarstan.

      - The Ukrainian army cleared two more villages in the Sumy region of Russian
      occupiers.

      - Budanov visited Snake Island as well as some mining platforms in the Black
      Sea.

      managed to penetrate behind the last line of defence at Dobropillya and are
      now trying to hold their positions to allow more Russian reinforcements to move
      into the area. Ukraine is moving some of its elite corps into the area to stop
      the breakthrough, cutting the Russians off from supplies and reinforcements
      and gradually destroying their units. The 7th Army Corps of Ukrainian paratroopers
      was also moved into the area. The situation here is critical, but according

      of elite soldiers to move at a pace of 600 meters per day in three directions
      from the town of Pishchane to the southwestern part of Pokrovsk, with supplies
      continuously dropped by drones. Only 30 of them eventually reached Pokrovsk.
      The rest were killed by Ukrainian drones and artillery. The project does not
      talk about the fate of the 30 survivors, but at least some of them surrendered
      after the firefight, according to other sources.

      - Witkoff reportedly "misunderstood" the Russian ceasefire offer. Russia does
      not intend to withdraw from the Zaporizhzhya region, as Witkoff initially claimed,
      but instead demands that the Ukrainian army leave.

      - Ukrainian drones hit a refinery and bitumen plant near Saratov, Russia. A
      second refinery as far away as Komi was also hit, damaging a fuel storage facility.

      - The Russians reportedly moved some 100,000 troops to the front near Pokrovsk.
      Videos on social media also show that they are moving other heavy equipment
      to Pokrovsk and Zaporozhye.

      - Fico commented on the upcoming meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska,

    desc: 'The Telegraph claims that Putin has struck a deal with Libyan dictator
      Khalifa Haftar to trigger another wave of an artificial refugee crisis. There
      will be regular flights from Benghazi, Libya, to Minsk, Belarus, from where
      refugees will be sent to Poland. This would not be the first time. In the past,
      Russia has repeatedly helped to dispatch flights from the Middle East and countries
      in Central and North Africa in this way, and is probably also behind the hundreds
      of fake social media accounts that have regularly lured migrants to Europe''s
      generous welfare system and other ''paradise'' living conditions if they fly
      to Belarus. But smugglers confiscated the passports of interested migrants immediately
      after they got off the plane in Belarus and forced them to continue on foot
      or by bicycle to the Polish border, where they were abandoned to their fate.
      Incidentally, in the wider context, this makes perfect sense. European pro-Kremlin
      political parties are, in the vast majority of cases, also anti-immigration.
      Thus, Putin can simultaneously destabilise Europe through managed migration
      and gain political influence in national parliaments by profiling the fifth
      column as the one that will save us from migration. Create a problem while at
      the same time telling people that you are the only one who can solve it. In
      a way, it''s brilliant. And unfortunately, we see it working every day. But

      told Trump that the question of ceding territory to Russia had long been answered:
      the Ukrainian constitution clearly states that Ukraine is indivisible, and therefore
      no Ukrainian politician, not including the president, can sanctify any surrender
      of territory to the occupiers. According to analysts, Putin''s offer is a tactic
      that has been repeated many times before, whereby Russia throws an unacceptable
      offer on the table in order to delay possible sanctions, present itself as a
      party willing to negotiate, and finally accuse Ukraine of blocking peace negotiations.

      Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions and freeze the front there if Ukraine withdraws
      from Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It is almost certain that Ukraine will not
      agree to such terms because they simply do not make sense. Ukraine is reportedly
      ready for a full ceasefire, but it will never recognise Russia''s claim to the

      was supposed to have bought fibreglass in Belarus from the Polock-Steklovolokno
      plant and then sold it to the company Moldavizolit in Tiraspol in occupied Transnistria.
      The trucks with the suspicious cargo were intercepted by Romanian customs officers
      at the Albita border crossing. The value of the goods is around 3 million aur.

      - The "Russian Peace Foundation" nominated the Presidents of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan
      and Tajikistan - Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Sadyr Japarov and Emomali Rakhmon - for
      the "Leo Tolstoy Peace Prize". The prize was first awarded last year by the
      African Union. In fact, Russia uses this prize to honour leaders who are loyal
      or helpful to Russia in its expansionist wars.

      - The Kremlin has contacted Ethiopia to ask its Ethiopian Airlines to lease
      planes and crew to Russia to help maintain the number of scheduled flights,
      which have begun to decline due to a shortage of spare parts for transport planes.
      But the Ethiopian government rejected Russia''s request over fears of Western
      sanctions.

      - The Russians began dropping leaflets around Pokrovsk calling on residents
      to report Ukrainian army positions to the Russians and "welcome their victorious
      liberators". The Ukrainians also intercepted a communication according to which
      the Russian command ordered its troops to capture Pokrovsk by 1 September.

      - 15 Ukrainian citizens hold a hunger strike at the Dariali border crossing
      in Georgia. These are people who have been deported by Russia but whom Georgia
      does not want to let into the country because of the alleged security risk.

      - This is the fifth time that Latvia has auctioned the so-called Moscow House,

      as everyone expected, given who occupies the White House and with what mental

      talks if there was a "swap of territory" and the Trump team enthusiastically
      welcomed it. What territory Russia wants to "swap" is not clear. According to
      some sources, the Russians were to offer a ceasefire instead of peace, and also
      that the US would not officially recognize the Russian occupation for the time
      being, and that the question of legitimate claims to the occupied territories
      would be "deferred" for up to 99 years. But that would de facto mean that Russia
      will keep the territories, just claiming "de jure" that it is not for another
      100 years, without anyone doing anything about it. At the same time, Trump announced
      that he would want to meet with Putin in the coming days, and eventually with
      Putin and Zelensky at the same time. He also didn''t rule out more sanctions

      to create a common army in order to have a tool to put pressure on countries
      that refuse EU legislation". Russian propaganda has reached a whole new level
      of moronicness.

      - As Ukrainian drones use Russian mobile networks to share data and navigate
      during raids on targets in Russia, the Russian authorities are preemptively
      shutting down the internet in many areas. And often not just for a few hours,
      but for days. In Vladivostok, for example, residents there have not had access
      to mobile internet for a week.

      - At night, the Russians bombed a recreational area in the suburb of Zaporozhye.
      Two people were killed and at least twelve others injured, including four children.
      Photos from the scene show that only civilians were on the premises.

      - President Zelensky announced that during a meeting with SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk,
      he had approved new subversion and sabotage actions against Russia, the effect
      of which will reportedly be seen in the coming weeks.

      - The Russians hit the gas infrastructure in Orlovka near Odessa last night.
      The aim of the attack is apparently to stop the flow of gas from Azerbaijan
      to Ukraine before the coming autumn.

      - Trump says that if the price of oil drops another ten dollars a barrel, Russia
      will have to end the war because it will no longer be able to keep its economy
      alive.

      - Trump is scheduled to meet with the president of Azerbaijan and the prime
      minister of Armenia on Friday. The United States has thus completely squeezed
      Russia out of mediating the conflicts in the Caucasus.

      - The Kremlin''s attempt to tame fuel prices by banning exports is not working.
      Prices continue to rise, breaking new records every day.

      - Azerbaijan has reportedly started producing 122mm and 152mm artillery shells
      for the Ukrainian army.

      Rostov region with rockets.

    desc: 'Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow today, where talks between the US delegation
      and the Kremlin began shortly afterwards. Donald Trump says the outcome of the
      talks will affect what tariffs or other measures the United States imposes on
      Russia. It is therefore certain that (lil)Putin will try to bribe Trump with
      some trivial concession. According to Bloomberg, Putin is likely to offer the
      Americans a partial ceasefire, namely that the Russian air force will stop shelling
      Ukrainian cities and energy installations deep behind the front lines. Quite
      frankly: Russian airstrikes are already of minimal military significance. Every
      now and then a training ground or an airfield is among the targets, but the
      damage in such cases is not essential to developments on the front, and much
      more often the Russians destroy civilian infrastructure with the simple aim
      of terrorising and demoralising the Ukrainian population.

      real father.

      - As a result of the Ukrainian airstrikes, the price of oil in Russia has risen
      by 7% in a single day and is at an all-time high. The recent airstrikes have
      brought the Novokubyshevsk refinery to a complete halt and the Ryazan refinery

      of petrol and oil in order to ensure that Russians have enough fuel.

      its military capabilities in Kaliningrad since 2017, including air defence systems,
      surface-to-surface missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as Iskander missile
      systems capable of carrying nuclear warheads. He said the Russians'' goal is
      to block the movement of NATO forces to the Baltics in the event of a conflict.
      The general said NATO cannot strike first as a matter of principle, but must
      respond if Russia launches aggression. In that case, he said, the "legitimate
      response" would be to strike Kaliningrad and military bases deeper inside Russia
      and Belarus. Frankly, such "enclaves" create completely unnecessary tensions
      all over the world. But none of them threaten Europe as much as Kaliningrad.

      the punishment of persons who "intend to threaten or harm the constitutional

      Republic by monitoring another on its territory for a foreign power by means

    desc: 'According to the head of Ukrainian intelligence, Russia has launched a
      massive arms build-up in recent months not primarily because of Ukraine, but
      because it is preparing for a potential conflict with NATO that could erupt
      by 2030. Russia has therefore also stepped up the hybrid part of its war with
      the West and is trying to destabilize NATO and the EU from within through local
      political parties and movements so that the alliances are not prepared for a
      possible clash with Russia. Through this lens, any politician who calls for
      weakening the EU or leaving NATO is automatically a Russian collaborator, regardless

    detail: '- According to the Moldovan president, Russia is financing an absolutely
      unprecedented disinformation campaign in the country and financially supporting
      several pro-Russian parties in order to turn the country''s helm towards the
      east. Also involved in the funding is Ilan Șor, a pro-Russian oligarch who owned
      six television stations in Moldova and is being prosecuted in absentia for extensive
      corruption. Ilan Șor is also allegedly behind the "MEGA" conference, which the
      collaborator Dostal was heading to before Moldova expelled him from the country.

      - Olga Skabaeva admitted on her programme that the Russian army bombed the hospital
      in Kamianske. But she claims that it served as a rehabilitation centre for wounded
      Ukrainian soldiers. Even if this were true - which it is not, because the dead
      and wounded are almost exclusively women, civilians - it would still be a war
      crime to attack wounded soldiers in a hospital.

      - Last night, Ukrainian special forces under military intelligence (HUR) launched
      a successful raid by sea on the Tendrivska Spit in the occupied Kherson region.
      In doing so, they eliminated a Russian unit and destroyed a Russian Rosa radar
      and a Zont EW system.

      - Ukrainian intelligence hacked into the servers of the puppet government of
      Crimea and extracted documents proving the systematic abduction of children
      from the occupied territories. The documents contain thousands of names and
      even include the locations where the children were moved.

      - The Russians hit with Grad missiles a place near Kharkiv where civilians were
      waiting for humanitarian aid to be handed out. At least five civilians were
      killed on the spot and others were injured.

      - Belarus is increasing its military-industrial production to help Russia with
      its arms build-up. At the same time, it is rapidly depleting its own fragile
      economy.

      - Several Ukrainian brigades have received new Bohdan guns, and the conversion
      of infantry brigades into heavy mechanised formations continues.

      - Mariupol is facing a critical water shortage. Water from the taps either does
      not flow at all or flows muddy and heavily polluted.

      - Russian missiles hit a Ukrainian training ground near Chernihiv yesterday.
      Three soldiers died and 18 others were injured in the airstrike.

      - Ukraine''s SBU has already recorded more than 10,000 attacks in which the
      Russians used banned chemical weapons.

      - The Ukrainians eliminated Andrei "Fjord" Sobek, the commander of the Wagner
      Group reconnaissance unit.

      - Trump announced that Ukrainian refugees can remain on US soil until the end
      of the war.

      - China rejected a US demand that it stop buying Russian oil.

      - Lithuania is moving its air defense battery to the Belarusian border due to
      a drone threat.

    desc: 'An earthquake measuring a staggering 8.8 on the Richter scale struck off
      the coast of Russia''s Kamchatka today. The epicentre was below sea level some
      136 km east of the peninsula''s shores. This was followed by a series of smaller
      tremors of around 5 magnitude. As a result, Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands
      were hit by a tsunami that reached heights of between 3-4 metres, but at its
      peak the waves reached heights of 10-15 metres. Some coastal towns were flooded,
      including the port of Severo-Kurilsk. In Petropavlovsk, the ceiling of the Elizovo
      airport collapsed. The Kamchatka thermal power plant TPP-1 was damaged. The
      Russian submarine base Rybachiy, where strategic submarines from the Russian
      Pacific Fleet are moored, is also likely to have suffered damage. The tsunami
      then hit Japan, and is expected to hit Hawaii and the west coast of America
      this afternoon. And this is what happened [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0vGis7i9KYVABHMryoqoiTt8zGWcQsXzjKcmh9DAWS2m59PChwKvCEhAo9tioPJXvl):

    desc: 'Polish intelligence has stated that the same Colombian man serving an eight-year
      prison sentence in the Czech Republic for the arson attack on the bus depot
      is also behind at least two arson attacks in Poland. In all cases, he acted
      on instructions from the Russian FSB, according to both Polish and Czech intelligence
      services. He faces up to life imprisonment for terrorism in Poland and it is
      possible that the Czechs will hand him over to the Poles when he serves his
      first sentence in the Czech Republic. Poland has already detained 32 people
      in connection with similar attacks and attempted attacks. The key is to remember,
      however, which parties and personalities in the Czech Republic have downplayed
      or ridiculed the information provided by the Interior Ministry and the secret
      services. They did not do so because they believed it to be untrue. They did
      it because it suited Russia. And now for more [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid025bK4ZgSd8o1iGxzU7vEQna4dYAWoBLjve147JxymMiMffxCyRStWpA67NGiwNQTEl):

    detail: "- The military police are investigating who is behind the leaks of military\
      \ documents that are being distorted and then misused by Russian propaganda.\
      \ In any case, the person who is making them public is Pavel Ruzicka, a member\
      \ of parliament for ANO. In the past, he has spread several other pieces of\
      \ Russian propaganda, including one about a Russian pilot who \"humiliated\"\
      \ an F-35 fighter pilot and \"remotely shut down his systems\".\n- Belarusian\
      \ hackers from the Silent Crow group stole a massive amount of data from the\
      \ IT infrastructure of Russian Aeroflot (reportedly 20 TB) and then almost completely\
      \ destroyed it. Aeroflot lost its website, ticket database, internal IT services\
      \ and reportedly around 7,000 servers. Repairs may take up to six months and\
      \ the damage caused is estimated at around USD 50 million.\n- The situation\
      \ near Pokrovsk continues to deteriorate for the Ukrainian defenders. The Russians\
      \ have again made slight advances and their sabotage units are regularly infiltrating\
      \ the city itself. But they are paying heavily in manpower and equipment for\
      \ each advance. The Russians have also made a foray to Kupyansk on the Kharkov\
      \ part of the front.\n- The Moscow School of Economics is opening a new master's\
      \ program called \"International Corporate Compliance,\" which is officially\
      \ designed to teach students how to \"identify sanctions risks,\" or will teach\
      \ young Russian economists how to circumvent anti-Russian sanctions.\n- Ukraine's\
      \ SBU detained a 24-year-old Belarusian citizen near the border with Belarus,\
      \ who was recruited by the Belarusian KGB via Telegram to conduct espionage\
      \ against Ukraine and map its defensive positions. He now faces life in prison.\n\
      - Communist Ondrej Dostal was expelled from Moldova after the country branded\
      \ him a risk to its national security and confiscated his diplomatic passport.\
      \ Dostal was travelling to Chisinau for the \"Make Europe Great Again\" conference.\n\
      - The propagandist of the \"Donetsk People's Republic\" complained on Telegram\
      \ that people are leaving Donetsk en masse because the city has no water, nobody\
      \ takes away the waste and people do not see their future in the city.\n- According\
      \ to the IStories project, Russia masks the real losses in its own ranks by\
      \ keeping the killed soldiers as deserters for a long time. As a result, it\
      \ also does not have to pay compensation to the families of fallen soldiers.\n\
      - Trump said he was no longer as interested in talking to Putin about anything\
      \ as he had been in the past, and announced that he was shortening the original\
      \ ultimatum to 10-12 days starting today because he \"already has an idea what\
      \ the response will be.\"\n- A drone from Belarus flew into Lithuanian airspace.\
      \ The Lithuanian air force is now tracking its route. It is said to be a Russian\
      \ drone that has gone astray, but it is probably not carrying explosives and\

      \ in Italy under the same conditions as during the Paris Games.\n- Poland has\
      \ added Turkish Bajraktar TB2 drones to its air force, and they are now conducting\

    desc: 'Today marks three years since Russia detonated explosives in one of the
      wings of the Olenivka penal colony to take the lives of captured Azov soldiers.
      They have long been seen by Russian state propaganda as its main target, portrayed
      as the ultimate evil and the reason for its invasion of Ukraine, and Russia
      has also refused to replace them in agreed prisoner exchanges. As a result of
      the powerful explosion, 54 Ukrainian prisoners lost their lives and at least
      150 others suffered serious injuries. Russian propaganda then immediately began
      to disseminate the usual ''alternative versions'', most often claiming that
      the Ukrainian government had killed them with a rocket because they supposedly
      wanted to testify about their alleged war crimes in the Donbas. This is, of
      course, a lie. Russia has long imprisoned hundreds of Azov prisoners and to
      date has presented no such coerced "testimony." Just as we have never seen alleged
      NATO bio labs or thousands of Ukrainian soldiers with Nazi tattoos. But we have
      seen plenty of captured Russians with such tattoos since. Because Russia always
      lies about everything. And most of all about what it does. But now [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0SRPqkLwWWiYpctzLXH3qFaKjoG9adv563fnArJk85oHYsFoHWhXCtmekC2FtcbM5l):

    detail: '- The Ukrainians used artillery and drones to destroy the remnants of
      the Russian 30th Motorized Artillery Regiment, which was trying to hold Kondrativka

    desc: 'Russian propaganda, with the help of local collaborators, is still trying
      to portray the anti-corruption protests in Ukraine as anti-war and against the
      "dictator" Zelensky, without realising that the fact that there are free protests
      in Ukraine actually proves that there is no dictatorship. It is, after all,
      the same reason why we do not see any protests in Russia. There, in fact, for
      taking part in them, one ends up in prison at best, at worst on the front line
      or killed outright by the FSB. At the same time, it is a lie that anyone in
      Ukraine is protesting for the rapid signing of a peace agreement. Ukrainians,
      despite, or perhaps because of, experiencing Russia''s brutality on a daily
      basis, are the last people who would want to give Putin anything for free. But

    detail: '- Zelensky has submitted a bill to parliament aimed at preserving the
      maximum independence of anti-corruption agencies, but at the same time preventing
      the organisations from succumbing to Russian influence. For example, the prosecutor''s
      office will not be able to assign investigators to cases that have long been
      deadlocked. At the same time, the law would introduce regular polygraph tests
      for those employees who have relatives in Russia. Western partners, who had
      criticised the previous change, have been broadly positive about the new proposal.

      - The Russian Foreign Ministry tweeted a picture of the state symbols of the
      three Soviet Baltic republics today, saying, "July 21 marks 85 years since the
      founding of the Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian SSRs. Despite the considerable
      advantage of large-scale Soviet investment and subsidies, these nations now
      find themselves on the economic fringes of Europe."

      - In Saratov, Russia, gas exploded in one of the local apartment blocks. Part
      of the building collapsed after the blast, killing at least three people, including
      a child. But one can assume that Russian propaganda will disseminate the disaster
      with a completely different context.

      - Turkish media claim that Chechen leader Kadyrov almost drowned in the sea
      while on holiday in Bodrum. Hotel staff managed to pull him out of the water,
      give him first aid and take him to hospital, from where he has since been discharged.

      - Ukrainian drones hit the Russian chemical plant Nevinnomyssky Azot near Stavropol
      last night. A gunpowder plant in Tambov was also hit and several key railway
      junctions were under attack.

      - The situation near Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad is critical. Having advanced on
      both flanks of the city, the Russians are beginning to attack the cities themselves
      from several sides simultaneously. Pokrovsk will be the next Bakhmut or Avdiivka.

      - The Ukrainian army reported that it lost internet access via Starlink terminals
      on the entire front for about two and a half hours today. According to SpaceX,
      a software glitch was to blame.

      - China is reportedly supplying Russia with small engines used in kamikaze drones,
      and masking the goods as "refrigeration units" to avoid sanctions.

      - Artillery exchanges, shootouts and airstrikes continue between Thailand and
      Cambodia. The two countries are expected to go to war.

      - In Sochi, Russia, two female Russian railway employees died yesterday when
      debris from a downed drone fell on their vehicle.

      - Estonia has officially sanctioned the Belarusian regime and its leader, Lukashenko,
      along with 272 others.

      - In St Petersburg, an unidentified man seriously injured two female employees
      of an industrial plant with a bow and arrow.

      - Poland officially renounced its commitment not to produce or use anti-personnel
      mines (Ottawa Convention).

      - Long queues for water are forming in Donetsk.

    title: Friday
    desc: 'According to Ukrainian intelligence, the Russians are trying to form "punishment
      regiments" from captured Ukrainian soldiers. If the prisoners refuse the offer,
      the Russians threaten to shoot them themselves. The aim is allegedly twofold:
      first, to use such a unit for propaganda purposes, but also to use the prisoners
      in real combat, as the Wagners used to do in the past: to storm Ukrainian army
      positions with minimal weaponry and in suicide attacks, to weaken the defenders,
      deplete their ammunition supplies and expose firing positions for subsequent
      artillery and mortar fire. This is again to be aided by the infamous blocking
      units, whose purpose is to prevent their own assault troops from withdrawing
      or fleeing the fight. At the same time, Ukraine has announced that the Russians
      are attempting to forcibly recruit all young men in the occupied territories
      into their own army as soon as they turn 18. And this is also happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid031g3SJXjxa1nosxuDrSqaZZEqBdNL5qvFNiFZn7BDE8CDcqvbQL1tMVoqNFhKQL6vl):

      \ region of Russia. No one survived the crash, including the crew of six, as\
      \ well as 5 children. This was an aircraft that first took off in 1976 and has\
      \ had several incidents since 2018 alone. Indeed, Angara Airlines recently applied\
      \ to the Russian authorities for exemptions from the usual regulations in order\
      \ to continue flying the machines, for which they do not have enough spare parts\
      \ due to Western sanctions.\n- Another conflict is brewing in the world. The\
      \ Cambodian army sent a barrage of Grads into Thai territory last night, killing\
      \ at least 12 civilians who were at the gas station where the Grad missiles\
      \ landed. Thailand responded with airstrikes on Cambodian artillery positions.\
      \ The two countries also closed their common border, evacuating border villages\
      \ and moving troops to the border. Thailand has requested an emergency UN meeting.\n\
      - Ukrainian drones attacked targets on the coast in southwestern Russia overnight.\
      \ The cities of Sochi and Adler report explosions. The drones reportedly flew\
      \ a very atypical route, from the southeast through Abkhazia - an occupied part\
      \ of Georgia. A fuel depot belonging to Russia's Lukoil was hit. One of the\
      \ Russian air defence missiles failed during the raid and landed on the city.\n\
      - A meeting between representatives of Ukraine and Russia took place in Turkey.\
      \ The Ukrainians told the other side that they were ready to commit to an immediate\
      \ ceasefire at any time. The two sides were also due to agree on a meeting between\
      \ the leaders of the two countries, with Erdogan and Trump in attendance, and\
      \ further prisoner exchanges.  \n- A Russian drone hit and virtually leveled\
      \ a nine-story apartment building in Odessa overnight today. Dozens of people\
      \ suffered injuries and firefighters are searching for potential victims. Another\
      \ drone hit the historic \"Pryvoz\" market building, and another hit a petrol\
      \ station.\n- Russian propaganda and its foreign disseminators falsely claim\
      \ that the current protests in Ukraine demand that Ukraine agree to a peace\
      \ deal with Russia. At the same time, Ukrainian intelligence has warned that\
      \ Russia is exploring how to use the protests to disintegrate Ukraine internally.\n\

      \ They will include air defense systems, Bradley vehicles and other equipment.\n\
      - Zelensky will already submit a proposal today that should lead to preserving\

    desc: 'In a recent editorial here, I mentioned Derek Huffman, an American who
      decided to move to Russia with his entire family to "protect it from LGBT people"
      and to live in a country that "espouses conservative values." Huffman then immediately
      enlisted in the army under the promise of working in the rear to earn his citizenship.
      But instead, the Russians shoved him into an assault unit and sent him to the
      front. So Derek''s wife spent the last weeks communicating with the Russian
      authorities to get her beloved back home. How''d that work out? By Derek coming
      home. Just not right away, and certainly not in one piece. The Ukrainians have
      announced that Derek was probably killed by their FPV drone, and they''re proving

    detail: '- Trump, in an attempt to distract from his scandals, now claims that
      Obama, Biden and Clinton were behind an alleged 2016 conspiracy to discredit
      Trump with false claims of cooperation with Russia. Yet in 2020, a Senate committee
      confirmed that there was election meddling by Russia, and the investigation
      led by Mueller led to the prosecution of 34 people, including more than two
      dozen Russian citizens. The only thing the investigation did not confirm was
      that Trump knowingly cooperated with Russia. Instead, several of his close associates
      and campaign chiefs were convicted.

      - The US envoy to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, said that China believed it was waging
      a proxy war with the United States by supporting Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
      China is said to be trying to keep Americans busy so that they cannot focus
      on other current threats. According to Whitaker, China must be held accountable
      for "subsidizing the killing in Ukraine."

      - If you''re still under any illusions about Trump''s intelligence, Trump said
      at a recent press conference that his planned actions will not just lower drug
      prices "by 30 or 40%, but by 1,000%, 600%, 500%, 1,500%, in short, numbers that
      people have thought were not possible until now." Unfortunately, it is this
      man who is to some extent at the heart of the Russian invasion of Ukraine today.

      - Russia sent a serial rapist to the front, who was wanted for seven years and,
      when caught, faced 20 years behind bars. But he never came to trial. In fact,
      he signed a contract with the Russian army and now he may well be the next "hero"
      of the Russian Federation.

      - Russia holds naval exercises in three places in the world at the same time:
      off the Polish coast, off the coast of Japan and in the Arctic. Some 15 000
      troops, 150 ships and submarines, and 120 aircraft and helicopters are taking
      part.

      - Ukraine lost one of its Mirage 2000s over the Volyn region. During the mission,
      shortly before the crash, the pilot radioed a technical fault and subsequently
      ejected. He survived the accident.

      - Ukrainian Colonel Maksym Kazban, the commander of the elite ''Lyut'' brigade,
      which is part of the Ukrainian police force and consists of members of the emergency
      and special forces, died in the accident.

      - Russia''s Rostov-on-Don was under heavy kamikaze drone attack last night.
      Three people were injured. In Novocherkassk, a Ukrainian drone hit a power plant
      and caused a power outage.

      - In Pokrovsk, actions are underway to detect and destroy more Russian saboteurs
      who took advantage of a gap in the Ukrainian defences and slipped into the city.

      - The Russian State Duma is debating a bill that would make the current regular
      seasonal mobilisation of new recruits a year-round mobilisation.

      - According to Ukrainian intelligence, the new Russian drone that serves as
      a decoy target is made up of 100% Chinese parts.

      - In Moldova, four left-wing parties have come together to form a pro-Russian
      electoral coalition. It is the same everywhere.

      - Finland confirms that cases of GPS signal jamming in the Baltic Sea area are

    desc: 'Thousands of people protested in Kiev and several other cities against
      the new law on transferring anti-corruption organisations to the control of
      the Supreme Prosecutor''s Office. Following pressure from home and abroad, Zelensky
      held a meeting with representatives of the SBU, NABU, SAPO, NACP, SBI and the
      Interior Ministry to hear their proposals and promised to present a joint plan
      soon to keep anti-corruption organisations effective and transparent. This is
      because, he argues, some organisations have been compromised by the Russians,
      which is why some investigations have been stalled for years. Some Ukrainians,
      on the other hand, think that the current move is happening because the anti-corruption
      organisations have had some of the current president''s associates in their
      crosshairs. Of course, the protests have not escaped Russian propaganda, which
      tries to portray them as a "revolt against the dictator Zelensky". What is certain

      move to approve a law that will see the anti-corruption agencies (NABU and SAPO)

      NABU has called on Zelensky to veto the proposal. But in parallel, Ukraine''s
      SBU uncovered a Russian spy in NABU ranks who was linked to former pro-Russian

    detail: '- The massive Russian airstrike last night primarily hit Kiev, Ivano-Frankivsk,
      and Kharkiv. One of the projectiles hit the entrance to the Lukianivska metro
      station, where hundreds of Kiev residents were sheltering at the time. After
      the attack, the station filled with smoke, but fortunately no one was injured.
      However, people elsewhere were not so lucky. For Ivano-Frankivsk, tonight was
      the biggest attack since the war began. In all, one person died in the Ukraine
      and 40 others were wounded. The Russians fired 426 kamikaze drones and 19 cruise
      missiles.

      - Ihor Hrushevskyi, 61, a former employee of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry
      and Ukrainian State Police, was found dead in the swimming pool of the Villajoyosa
      residential complex in Spain. Earlier, a Russian pilot who had deserted and
      handed over his helicopter to the Ukrainians was also killed in the same compound.

      - Russia has begun precautionary searches of all cargo ships in Russian ports
      to detect possible explosives, and at the same time Putin signed a new decree
      requiring cargo ships to obtain a permit from the FSB before entering Russian
      ports.

      - The Russian Defense Ministry released a report showing viewers for the first
      time how Shahed kamikaze drones are built at a plant in Yelabuza, Tatarstan.
      The report makes no secret of the fact that underage brigadiers are involved
      in building the deadly drones.

      - Ukrainian drones hit two key railway junctions near Rostov-on-Don. As a result,
      all rail traffic in the Rostov region has been disrupted.

      - Armenia released a Russian defector, whose extradition back to Russia had
      long been sought by the Kremlin, and even attempted to abduct the defector from
      the country.

      - The head of German intelligence announced that Russia had doubled the number
      of espionage and sabotage operations on German territory year-on-year.

      - According to Chinese customs data, Russia has almost doubled the volume of
      gold and silver exports to China in the last six months.

      - Peskov said it was "very important for Russia that Russians living in Azerbaijan
      are respected."

      - Azerbaijan has had a group of ex-convicts arrested who fought in Ukraine in

      of the cryptocurrency market, Russia has announced that it will fine or prosecute

      extensive use of cryptocurrencies to circumvent sanctions. China and India use
      it to pay Russia for oil and gas, and Russia uses crypto to buy Chinese and

      it does mind people using them for transactions that Russia cannot 100% control,

    detail: '- Ukrainians have coined a new phrase: "liberation on credit". In practice,
      this means that the Russians announce in advance that they have occupied a village,
      even though this is not true, and then start throwing hundreds of soldiers into
      the attack to actually occupy the village and satisfy both the home audience
      and the command. That is why we can read in Russian reports that a village should
      have been "liberated" ten times already, and yet it is still being fought over.

      - Donetsk and its surroundings are facing a critical water shortage. The occupation
      administration has announced that water will only flow every third day in Donetsk,
      Shakhtarsk and Makiivka, and every two days in Khartsyzsk, Ilovaisk, and Zuhres.
      Mariupol will have water every day, but only between 5pm and 9pm.

      - The Russians have found a new target: locomotives. Russian missiles and drones
      are thus increasingly hitting stationary locomotives, including those pulling
      civilian trains. Indeed, the Russians argue that railways are the primary way
      in which the Ukrainians transport manpower and material to the front.

      - Russian state media are now claiming that Azerbaijan helped Ukraine carry
      out Operation Spiderweb. This is, of course, nonsense, but the Russians are
      simply preparing the information space for a possible incursion into Azerbaijan
      in response to recent statements by President Aliyev there.

      - According to ISW, Putin is unlikely to avoid forced mobilization in the future,
      as the current high recruitment allowances for volunteers are draining the Russian
      economy. Analysts have likened Russia''s monetary and military policies to "burning
      the candle from both sides."

      - Vladimir Putin has ordered ministers to take further steps to restrict messaging
      apps that come from "hostile states", i.e. against Messenger, Whatsapp, Signal
      and others.

      - The Moscow region was under drone attack last night. Airports again had to
      cancel flights and Russian air defence forces worked over the area. Debris from
      one of the drones landed on a high-rise apartment building in Zelenograd.

      - Zelensky called on Russia to resume negotiations next week. At the same time,
      he said, top statesmen should meet, not "some historians." The Kremlin has not
      yet responded to the offer.

      - The European Parliament has ruled that Georgia cannot become a member of the
      EU until it takes steps to abandon its current path towards an authoritarian
      state.

      - AP reports that in the Central African Republic, Wagner''s men massacred 11
      civilians who entered the Ndassima gold mine compound.

      - In the occupied territories, the Russians are attempting to ban the Ukrainian
      language by repressing and terrorising those who still use it.

      - Britain has announced that it is lowering the price ceiling on oil from Russia
      from $60 to $47.60 per barrel.

      - An overnight airstrike killed 7 people in Ukraine and injured 28 others.

      is trying in vain to keep up, developing all sorts of drone-interceptors and
      improvising wherever it can. Thus, planes that have hitherto served as civilian
      machines - agricultural or sporting ones, for example - regularly fly over Ukraine,
      where two-man crews armed with machine guns, machine pistols and shotguns attempt
      to shoot down Shaheeds within a few dozen metres in aerial battles reminiscent
      of World War I air battles. But it''s extremely dangerous work, and many have
      paid for their heroism with their lives when they''ve been the unfortunate victims
      of their own air defense fire or when their machines have been hit by shrapnel

      - In a recent phone call, Trump reportedly urged Zelensky to take Ukraine on
      the offensive because, he said, you can''t win a war if you''re always on the
      defensive. Zelensky was supposed to have replied that this would be possible
      if Ukraine was properly armed.

      - During the firefight in the Kursk region, the Ukrainians liquidated a major
      of the Russian army, specifically the assistant commander of Unit 51620, Pavel
      Lukosik. Majors do not usually fight on the line of contact. Therefore, it is
      possible that he was sent into combat as a punishment.

      - Analysts say Moscow is trying to play "tough guy" at all costs and claim that
      the Russian economy is immune to its effects, but in reality the Russian economy
      is slowly falling apart and the Kremlin is increasingly busy trying to cover
      it up.

      - Russia sent 344 drones and 35 missiles or cruise missiles into Ukraine last
      night. Ukrainian air defense forces disabled a total of 185 drones and 23 missiles/rockets.
      A further 129 drones and 7 missiles/rockets fell outside their intended targets.

      systems of Russia''s Gazprom, copying data on 20,000 entities and subsequently
      destroying the compromised servers.

      - The commander of NATO forces in Europe, General Alexus Grynkewich, warns that
      as early as 2027 Russia could attack another European country and China could

      - The Ukrainians crossed the Russian border near the village of Gormal in the

      - The Ukrainian army destroyed a Russian sabotage group that attempted to infiltrate
      Pokrovsk.

      - According to Estonia, Russian losses in Ukraine have already exceeded those

      encirclement and force the Ukrainian garrison to leave the town. This is bound
      to happen eventually, as the Russians are already threatening the main supply
      routes and, having moved more reinforcements to the towns, are creeping to tighten
      the noose around both towns. At such a moment a Ukrainian counter-attack should

    desc: 'Unknown perpetrators set fire to a church in Transcarpathia and wrote the
      message "Hungarians under the knife" on it. Hungary has summoned the Ukrainian
      ambassador over this, and the Hungarian Foreign Minister is once again babbling
      about the ''systematic attack on the Hungarian minority in Ukraine''. But the
      Ukrainians are clear: The inscription was either written by a complete illiterate
      or by someone who does not use Cyrillic as his primary writing system. The characters
      for "d" and "ja" are written in a very... "strange" way. For context, it should
      be recalled that Ukraine has recently revealed that Hungarian intelligence operates
      in Transcarpathia and carries out very suspicious activities there. It is therefore
      quite possible that the arson attack was ordered or directly carried out by
      Hungary itself in order for Orbán to defend his anti-Ukrainian, or rather openly
      pro-Russian, positions and to further inflame ethnic tensions in western Ukraine.

    detail: '- The United States, along with eleven European countries, undertook
      a large-scale operation to dismantle the Russian hacking group NoName057(16).
      Authorities conducted a total of 24 raids, destroyed hundreds of servers, and
      issued arrest warrants for seven individuals, some of whom are located in the
      Russian Federation. The group is responsible for attacks on European defence,
      energy and government infrastructure.

      - A street exhibition has appeared in Moscow presenting Estonia, Latvia and
      Lithuania as non-existent states and their inhabitants as "subhumans". Aside
      from using the same rhetoric as Hitler''s Germany towards its perceived enemies,
      this is probably another piece in the mosaic of how Russia is preparing its
      population for an invasion of the Baltics.

      - Radio Free Europe has published a leaked recording of Russian MP Borodai describing
      the volunteers in the Russian ranks as "inferior infantry" and explaining that
      their sole purpose is to exhaust Ukrainian troops before the regular army attacks.
      He also describes the volunteers as an "expendable force".

      - The Russians dropped an aerial bomb on the town of Dobropillya in the Donetsk
      region in broad daylight. It landed on a busy street and hit the local Aurora
      supermarket and adjacent shops and cafes. According to initial information,
      at least two people were killed and around 27 injured. But the actual number
      of casualties is likely to rise.

      - Eleven years ago today, Russian-armed militias shot down Malaysian Airlines
      flight MH-17. All 298 passengers and crew members died. To this day, Russia
      has not admitted guilt, but has flooded the information space with dozens of
      alternative versions of the incident.

      - The United States has to dispose of 500 tonnes of humanitarian aid in the
      form of protein biscuits, which are in storage in Dubai, and there was no way
      to deliver them to those in need because of Trump''s decision to close down
      USAID.

    detail: '- Immediately after Trump''s "ultimatum", the Russians carried out another
      massive airstrike on cities across Ukraine. Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih, Vinnytsia and
      other places were hit. A total of 400 drones of various types were in the air.
      198 of them were shot down by the Ukrainian Air Defense Forces and another 145
      crashed due to the work of jammers. The attack caused several injuries.

      - In a joint action by Czech, Slovak and Ukrainian police, a Ukrainian man was
      arrested in Dnipro, who investigators say was behind the threats against Czech
      and Slovak schools. According to the Czech BIS, he was recruited by Russia for
      money. This is information that the Slovak police "mistakenly" withheld in their
      press releases.

      - The investigative daily Balkan Insight found that Russian intelligence and
      Wagner''s men organised the training of Moldovan volunteers in Serbia and Bosnia
      for the military coup in Moldova. Bosnia initially denied the information, but
      it later emerged that it was prosecuting several people in connection with the
      case.

      - The Russians used drones to hit the premises of the Polish company Barlinek
      in Vinnytsia. Several people were seriously injured. According to the Polish
      Prime Minister, the attack was completely deliberate. Barlinek has no links
      to the military-industrial complex. It is a flooring company.

      - Trump''s "50-day ultimatum" was met with universal enthusiasm on Russian social
      media. Military channels are crowing that in 50 days the Russian army will reach
      Kiev and thanking Trump for giving them enough time to inflict maximum damage
      on Ukraine.

      - Russia has ceremoniously granted Russian citizenship to American Daniel Martindale.
      He lived until recently in the Ukrainian-controlled part of the Donetsk region,
      from where he passed on information to Russian intelligence services about the
      positions of the Ukrainian army.

      - On Tuesday, a new law came into force in Finland that bans Russian and Belarusian
      entities from owning real estate in the country. According to Finnish Defence
      Minister Häkkänen, such a ban should have been in place long before the Russian
      invasion of Ukraine.

      - France, and later Italy, announced that they too would not participate in
      the purchase of US weapons for Ukraine. According to Macron, Europe should invest
      in the development of its own arms sector and not support the American one.

      - According to Polish Foreign Minister Sikorski, Europe should not pay for US
      weapons for Ukraine, but Russia itself through frozen assets.

      - During Trump''s State Department purge, several analysts who had been primarily
      focused on Ukraine and Russia were also fired.

      - Kazakhstan began construction of one of three coal-fired power plants that
      Russia promised to help build, but the construction never materialized.

      - The mayor of the Latvian town of Ogre was wounded in a Russian attack while
      handing over publicly collected vehicles to Ukrainian soldiers.

      - Russian authorities discovered the wreckage of a missing Mi-8 helicopter in
      the mountains near Cape Gadikan. None of the crew of five is believed to have
      survived.

      - In the Luhansk region, a transport aircraft belonging to the Russian Ministry

      an ethnic Hungarian, József Sebestyén, during an alleged forced mobilisation.
      He is therefore calling on the EU to impose sanctions on Ukrainian officials.
      Ukraine rejects all accusations. According to the official version, Sebestyén,
      after being mobilised, left his unit without permission and headed for hospital,
      where doctors there immediately had him admitted to a psychiatric clinic for
      an acute stress reaction. However, he died suddenly during his hospitalization.
      An autopsy determined the cause of death to be pulmonary embolism. At the same
      time, the autopsy report does not mention any external injuries or other signs
      of violence.

      - Putin claimed at a cabinet meeting that Russia does not have enough women.
      But this is probably a tactic to cover up the complete decimation of the male
      population as a result of the mobilization. There have always been more women
      than men in Russia, and the ongoing war certainly could not change this trend,
      quite the opposite.

      - Ukrainian Prime Minister Shmyhal will leave his current post and become the
      new Minister of Defence. The current defence minister, Rustem Umerov, is then
      expected to become Ukraine''s new ambassador to the United States.

      - Moscow has been hit by heavy rains, which have brought as much water as at
      any other time in two weeks. Some underground shopping malls, arcades and garages
      were completely flooded, and there were even several tens of centimetres of
      water in the streets.

      - Ukraine''s SBU detained a 27-year-old man in Rivne who had been recruited
      by Russians on Telegram and attempted to blow up a residential house to cause
      chaos and fear among residents.

      - The first of the new weapons packages for Ukraine, funded by NATO countries,
      will reportedly include missiles, air defense systems and artillery ammunition
      worth around $10 billion in total.

      - Five European countries have come out against the new trade deal with Ukraine:
      Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania.

      - According to Prime Minister Fialy, the Czech Republic will not participate
      in the purchase of US weapons for Ukraine because it is already investing in
      other initiatives.

      - During his meeting with Lavrov, the Chinese president promised that China
      would continue to deepen its relations with Russia.

      - The European Union extended temporary protection for Ukrainian refugees for

      gives Putin 50 days to make peace with Ukraine or he will impose 100% tariffs
      on goods from all countries that buy Russian gas or oil (hello, Slovakia!).
      But Trump''s newfound "toughness" is somewhat marred by the fact that in his
      last phone call with Putin, Axios reports that Putin told him that he intends
      to conquer the remaining parts of the Russian-annexed areas in the next 60 days.
      The phone call took place on 3 July. Ten days passed yesterday. So it seems
      that Trump has decided to give Putin his 60 days. In addition, citing sources
      close to the Kremlin, Reuters says that Putin intends to eventually not only
      ignore Trump''s ultimatum, but moreover is prepared to escalate the conflict
      with the United States itself and force Trump to agree to Russia''s version
      of "peace." After all, Medvedev called the ultimatum "theatrical" and Lavrov
      said that Russia had already stood up to many different sanctions, and ridiculed
      the ultimatum in the style of "it was once 24 hours, then 1000 days... and you

      "destructive statements" and putting pressure on Russia. Dmitriev thus confirmed
      what experts have been saying for a long time: Only brute force applies to Russia.

      - The Ukrainian army has included new rounds in its arsenal for 5.56mm (NATO)
      rifles, which contain a projectile that splits into several smaller ones when
      fired and can thus effectively destroy FPV drones at a distance of around 50
      meters using existing rifles, similar to shotguns.

      - According to Ukrainian military intelligence, the Russians are significantly
      increasing the volume of their propaganda targeting the population in African
      states. By the end of this year, Russia Today, the Russian state television
      station, is due to begin broadcasting in Amharic to the people of Ethiopia.

      he does not plan to stop the war, but instead will escalate the war to conquer
      all areas he considers Russian.

    desc: 'For the third year, Russia has continued to regularly jam GPS signals throughout
      the eastern Baltic Sea. Experts agree, based on triangulation of positional
      data collected, that Russian jammers located in Kaliningrad are to blame, likely
      those from the Okunovo base where Russia''s GT-01 Murmansk-BN electronic warfare
      systems are located, but also from other locations in the Russian enclave. Unfortunately,
      the disturbances are not only affecting military facilities and equipment. The
      primary victim of jamming is civilian transport, especially cargo ships and
      civilian aircraft, which have to rely on alternative means of navigation when
      flying across the Baltic Sea. In addition, the Russians are not only jamming

      data to the receivers of the signal. This can have fatal consequences, especially
      when the autopilot system operates with such a false signal during flight. NATO

    detail: '- The Ukrainian raid on the command post of the Russian 155th Naval Brigade
      has a seventh confirmed casualty among the officer corps. It is Major Shamil
      Murtazaliyev. In total, the Ukrainians eliminated one major general, two colonels,
      two lieutenant colonels, one captain and one major in a single airstrike. And
      it is still possible that the list is not final.

      - New Caledonia has now become a partially independent republic from France
      and will have representation in international organisations. President Macron
      wished the people there good luck and thanked all the politicians for their
      work. Because France is a democratic country that is not ruled by a homicidal
      maniac like Russia.

      - The Ukrainian army has again managed to improve its positions in the Sumy
      region and also near Pokrovsk, which the Russians have been trying to tactically
      encircle for several weeks. In general, however, the Russian army is still making
      moderate advances.

      - Another former member of Wagner''s group has fled to Finland and requested
      asylum in the country. The Finnish authorities have detained him and it is likely
      that he too will end up in prison, as he was actively involved in the fighting
      in Ukraine.

      - No drones or missiles flew into Ukraine tonight. The last time that happened
      was on 8 May. But then during the morning the Russians sent a total of 60 kamikaze
      drones.

      - Fico has announced that he will support further anti-Russian sanctions, including
      an end to Russian gas supplies, if Slovakia receives energy guarantees from
      the European Union.

      - Putin is reportedly pushing Iran to agree to a deal with the United States
      that would ban it from enriching uranium altogether. Iran, however, rejects
      such an option.

      - In his meeting with Lavrov, the North Korean dictator promised that his country
      would continue to unconditionally support Russia in its war against Ukraine.

      - The SBU tracked down the Russian agents who recently murdered their colleague
      in Kiev. After a brief shootout, they shot both of them dead.

      - South Korean intelligence estimates that North Korea has already provided
      Russia with 12 million pieces of artillery ammunition.

      - Reichl said that if his party succeeds in the elections, it will distance
      itself from the "Kiev regime".

      - According to Ukrainian intelligence, there are now 700,000 Russian troops
      on Ukrainian territory.

      - The Ukrainians hit a Russian oil refinery near the town of Kstovo last night.

      - The Russians bombed a hospital in Slavyansk last night.

    desc: 'Zelensky says Ukraine has found an answer to Russia''s Shahed kamikaze
      drones and recently asked partner states to help fund a solution. That solution
      is Ukrainian-made interceptor drones that can destroy Shaheds with kinetic force
      and have reportedly already made several hundred notches on their imaginary
      arms in the form of downed drones over the Kiev region since their live deployment.
      In terms of price/performance ratio, such a solution makes maximum sense. After
      all, such drones are relatively cheap. Certainly cheaper than Shahed drones
      alone and many times cheaper than missiles for air defense systems. Moreover,
      they are not dependent on launchers, and it is therefore possible to launch
      such drones from different locations and thus avoid detection by Russian drones
      that seek out Ukrainian air defense positions for missile targeting. Hopefully,
      then, mass production will soon be able to get underway. But now for more [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0XXEgVuN4Whe7JdxaDBydg5bQrWNFZWjhunvYJkUJZWaHuihFho3bJ3aEzxaC8cAHl):

      cooperation with Kiev for industrial espionage and their own enrichment. Some
      companies are said to have made contact with Ukrainian drone developers and
      offered to help, only to steal Ukraine''s original technology and build their
      own drones based on it, which they are now using to compete for arms contracts.
      Other companies reportedly claim their drones have been "battle-tested in Ukraine",

    detail: '- At a Russian training camp for elite paratroopers in Ryazan, one of
      the cadets killed his commander - the hero of a "special military operation",
      Sergeant Ivan Selin. Cadet Ilya Kazantsev tied Selin''s main and reserve parachute
      lines together and Selin subsequently killed himself during a practice jump.
      Investigators then found another parachute "modified" in this way, which belonged
      to the platoon commander. He did not take part in the jumps that day and survived.

      - The Russians sent 79 kamikaze drones into Ukraine last night. The target this
      time was primarily Kharkiv - the wreckage of one of the drones landed on a maternity
      hospital in Kharkiv, which had to be evacuated - but also other cities. For
      example, another military commissariat was hit, this time in Odessa. Another
      Russian drone then hit stables near Odessa. One horse was killed and several
      others were injured by shrapnel.

      - Russian military bloggers have been sounding the alarm for several days now
      about the situation of Russian marines in the Sumy region. They say the Ukrainians
      are slowly recapturing some villages, while the Russians are running out of
      ammunition, supplies and routes are constantly under attack by Ukrainian drones,
      making it impossible to reinforce the crews, let alone make rotations.

      Captain Alexander Shipunov.

      in occupied Melitopol. At least five Russian soldiers were killed in the blast.
      Their identities and ranks are not yet known.

    desc: 'BIS has released its latest report on the security of the Czech Republic.
      It states that Russian counter-intelligence in the Czech Republic is recruiting
      Telegram users with money to carry out espionage and sabotage actions to create
      fear, undermine trust in the state and discourage support for Ukraine. A detained
      Colombian who recently received eight years for an attempted arson attack on
      a bus depot was reportedly recruited by a man nicknamed "Adrian" who promised
      him $3,000 for the attack. The BIS is said to have subsequently uncovered and
      thwarted several other such actions before the act occurred, including a terrorist
      attack on entities involved in the Czech Munitions Initiative. According to
      BIS, the Russians are purposely recruiting poor foreigners so that they do not
      have to sacrifice their own people and cover their real tracks. The BIS report
      also mentions Russian disinformation. According to it, the Russians mainly use
      domestic actors to spread it, who have made a business out of such activities.
      But it also mentions channels run directly by Russian intelligence, such as
      the "Peasant Reason" telegram channel, which is subscribed to by 15 000 Czechs.
      Finally, the report also mentions the local branch of the Russian Orthodox Church,
      which Russia is said to be using to spread its influence. In truth, with a few

    detail: '- Trump now claims that the pause in arms deliveries to Ukraine was ordered
      by Defense Secretary Hegseth without Trump''s knowledge. The White House is
      said to have learned everything only from the media. Trump therefore promptly
      promised to supply Ukraine with a staggering ten missiles for Patriot systems.
      Meanwhile, the aid package that Hegseth stopped contained 30 such missiles,
      as well as a large amount of other ammunition and weaponry. The Trump cabinet
      has thus rather fallen into the original Russian propaganda strategy of ''good
      Tsar, bad Boyar'', where everything positive is attributed to the ''leader'',
      while everything negative is blamed on the people the leader is surrounded by,
      who have ''deceived'' the leader.

      - Musk''s AI assistant "Grok" has had some interesting mood swings in recent
      days. First, he angered the pro-Russian part of Twitter when he began to vehemently
      defend Ukraine and criticize Russia for its aggression in Ukraine and propaganda,
      then, presumably, Musk''s AIs "tuned him out" and Grok, in turn, began to praise
      Hitler, criticize Jews and pick on world leaders. Turkey had Grok completely
      blocked after repeated vulgar comments about Erdoğan.

      - The SBU today detained two Chinese men in Ukraine who were involved in espionage
      to steal sensitive data on Ukraine''s Neptune missiles. A 24-year-old Chinese
      citizen attempted to recruit Ukrainians who worked on the missile development
      to produce top-secret documents, which he then wanted to send back to China
      through his father.

      - In Rostov-on-Don, Russia, a massive warehouse fire raged for a second day.
      The fire has already spread to an area of 15 000 m2. Officially, it is a household
      goods warehouse, but according to locals and some analysts, the Russians were
      using the site to assemble FPV drones.

      - Russian police detained two Russian teenagers in St. Petersburg who jokingly
      took a picture with an American flag in front of the FSB building. As punishment,
      they had to make a video of them stepping on an American flag, holding a Russian
      flag and singing the Russian anthem.

      - American singer Beyoncé performed at the concert in a dress that probably
      accidentally resembled the Russian tricolour. However, Russian propaganda saw
      this as intentional and immediately started referring to the singer as "one
      of us".

      - The International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague has issued arrest warrants
      for two Russian allies: Taliban head Haibatullah Akhundzada and Judge Abdul
      Hakim Haqqani. Both are being prosecuted for crimes against humanity.

      - A London court found three men guilty of arson attacks on Ukrainian businesses
      in London. Investigators say the attack was ordered by people from Russia''s
      Wagner Group.

      - Russian authorities have approved China''s devastating logging in areas of
      Siberia, and even near the protected Baikal. You won''t hear better news about
      the state of the Russian economy today.

      - The leader of the Russian-backed junta currently ruling Burkina Faso has announced
      that his country is halting all mineral exports to Western countries.

      - According to a Ukrainian report, Russian Su-34 and Su-35 fighter jets contain
      up to 99% of parts from Western countries - most from the US, Japan and the
      EU.

      - In a recent raid on a Russian base near Donetsk, Colonel Vasyly Skyrnevsky,
      the commander of the Russian 8th All-Union Army''s spies, was killed.

      - Trump said that Putin is always nice to him, but at the same time "throws
      a lot of crap at him that has proven to be meaningless over time."

      - According to Chancellor Merz, the possibilities to resolve the war in Ukraine
      through diplomacy have been completely exhausted.

      - Russia is preparing a programme similar to the abolished USAID to expand its
      influence in the world.

      - Ukraine''s Naftogaz has commissioned a new oil well despite Russian airstrikes.

      Defense Forces shot down 303 drones and 7 cruise missiles. Another 415 were
      "lost from the radar" due to the work of jammers. In recent weeks, Ukraine has
      focused its airstrikes on the very supply chain that makes Shahed drones possible

      navigation and control components, and of course institutions developing aerospace

    desc: 'Investigators say the recent explosion in a village near Zhytomyr, which
      damaged dozens of houses, killed several people and injured dozens more, was
      not caused by a Russian airstrike, but by the illegal manufacture of explosives
      in unsuitable conditions. The five men are now facing criminal charges and could
      face multi-year sentences for making explosives on the premises of the former
      cowshed according to their own procedures, without proper training or licensing
      and without the necessary safety measures. The explosives produced were probably

      showing that the commander of the Russian military district "South", Major General
      Zemskov, has ordered a significant increase in personnel at the Russian military
      base in Gyumri, Armenia. According to the report, the garrison there is to be
      reinforced by units from the Russian 8th, 18th, 49th and 58th Allied Armies.
      The Russians deny any additional troop movements to Armenia, as did Armenian
      officials recently.

      - The daily Kommersant reports that Russia now imports more food than it exports.
      The volume of Russian exports has fallen to $12 billion, while imports have
      risen to $12.9 billion. Russia is now desperately trying to artificially increase
      the value of the ruble in order to slow food price inflation.

      - In his latest piece, Russian blogger Sladkov writes that (Russia) "needs the
      whole of Ukraine, and it needs it as a relative or friend, not as a violent
      neighbour who has been slapped in the face and so has calmed down for a while".
      According to Sladkov, only the Russian army can solve the "Ukrainian problem".

      - NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an interview that China might try
      to invade Taiwan, in which case it would likely turn to Russia to attack a NATO
      state to prevent the alliance from coming to Taiwan''s aid.

      - Lavrov said that if Ukraine wants peace, it must stop claiming "Russian" areas,
      lift all sanctions against Russia, return seized property, and also "include
      denazification and demilitarization" in any peace agreement.

      - At least 12 people were killed and 69 others injured, including several children,
      in an overnight wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine. The primary targets of
      the airstrikes this time were Kharkiv, Zaporozhye and Odessa. Military commissariat
      buildings were also hit again.

      - The Russians released a video of their FPV drone hitting a pair of endangered
      pelicans in mid-air. Probably the Russians mistook them for Ukrainian drones.
      Because they''re i**ots.

      - According to Russian channels, the Russian 810th Marine Brigade suffered huge
      losses during the fighting in the Kursk region. Gubarev writes that of the 500
      or so soldiers, 40 survived.

      - The Russians are moving some units from the Zaporozhye front to Sumy to try
      to bolster the withering Russian offensive in the Sumy direction.

      - Trump threatened tariffs of an additional 10% on all countries that share
      the BRICS group''s "anti-American agenda".

      - Iran and Russia''s allies, the Yemeni Houthis, sank the Greek cargo ship Magic
      Seas in the Red Sea.

      in recent weeks to weaken Russian influence. To that end, it says it is recruiting
      volunteers in areas such as North Ossetia and Adygea.

      - The suspension of arms deliveries to Ukraine, according to the US media, was
      not due to a decision by Trump or because of low stocks in military warehouses,
      but purely on the initiative of Trump''s defence secretary, the ultra-Christian
      former Fox host Hegseth.

      - For the first time in history, the Russian statistics agency Rosstat has completely

      Russia does not want to provide any official information that would reveal its
      losses in the war with Ukraine.

      night. The Russians claim to have defused 120 drones. It is not clear if any

      eight times in this way in the first year of the war - most notably during the

      He said that unfortunately there are politicians who beat their chests, saying
      "Ukraine is good" and "Russia is bad". However, one of those countries sees
      the United States as its partner, the other as its primary strategic enemy.

      - Italian Prime Minister Meloni, like Trump, claims that the United States has
      not actually stopped supplying arms to Ukraine. It is only said that there was
      a brief pause in deliveries so that the Americans could take stock.

      - The Ukrainians hit the Russian military airport of Borisoglebsk near Voronezh
      last night. The airstrike reportedly destroyed a guided missile depot, a training
      aircraft and damaged other machinery.

      of his Russian citizenship and plan to deport him back to his original homeland.

      - The Russians have again cut the high-voltage power lines that feed the Zaporozhye
      nuclear power plant. It has had to switch to emergency generators.

      continue with the killing". "It''s not good," he added.

      military installations in the country. And no wonder. There is a Swedish Air
      Force base in the Swedish town of Västerås, and just a few hundred meters away
      from it is a relatively new Russian Orthodox church that has a tower that is
      a hair taller than it was planned to have, plus it overlooks the airport, hardly
      any services are held there, and the priest there was recently decorated by
      the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). That the Russian Orthodox Church
      serves the Kremlin''s influence operations is, of course, not news. It has been
      warned against by the Baltic states, which is why the Orthodox Church of the
      Moscow Patriarchate is now banned in Ukraine. After all, even its supreme leader,
      Patriarch Kirill, was a KGB agent in the past. And if someone started to look

    desc: 'The Russians are breaking records for the umpteenth time. Last night, 539
      kamikaze Shahed drones and 11 cruise missiles/arrows targeted Ukraine. The primary
      target this time, with a few exceptions, was Kiev. Miraculously, no one died,
      but 26 people were injured or maimed, including a 10-year-old girl. The airstrike
      destroyed 5 ambulances that were already intervening at the sites where the
      first wave of drones and missiles had landed. Even the Polish consulate building
      was damaged. The airstrike came just hours after Trump had a phone call with
      Putin. So it was certainly a show of force to put pressure on Trump. In any
      case, Trump is not reporting this time that the phone call was "the best" as
      usual. On the contrary, he reported that he was "very disappointed" by the phone
      call. He said Putin struck him as no longer being himself and not wanting to
      end the war. No, Donald, the fact that Putin wants to go to war is, on the contrary,

      graffiti on a house in St Petersburg, tried to set fire to a building near the
      railway infrastructure and finally tried to plant a bomb under the car of an
      employee of a local arms factory. Of course, all of this is perfectly caught
      on camera, including the suspect''s convulsive testimony, so this is probably
      another cinematic masterpiece from the world-famous Kremlwood.

      - A clarification on yesterday''s report: the commander of the Russian Black
      Sea Fleet did indeed die, but not in the Moscow bombing - two separate events.
      Vice Admiral Akhmerov was supposed to have been killed in a Ukrainian raid on
      a base in Crimea. One of the directors of the Russian FSB, Alexei Komkov, was
      supposed to have been killed in the Moscow bombing.

      - In the Czech Republic, which takes "expensive oil from the West", the average
      price of a litre of diesel in June was 33.82 CZK. In countries where "cheap
      Russian oil" flows, such as Slovakia and Hungary, the price per litre of diesel
      averaged 35.96 and 37.04 CZK respectively. When converted into the purchasing
      power of the population, the difference is even greater.

      - Ukrainian missiles recently destroyed the command post of the 155th Guards
      Marine Brigade in the village of Korenovo near Kursk. Major General of the Russian
      Navy and "Hero of the Russian Federation" Mikhail Gudkov and his associate Lieutenant
      Colonel Nariman Shikhaliyev were killed in the strike.

      - Iran is reportedly preparing to mine the Strait of Hormuz. If this actually
      happens, oil prices on world markets can be expected to skyrocket, which would
      help Russia to finance its war economy.

      - The Russians have raided two targets in Zhytomyr. One was an industrial site,
      the other was a nearby gas station. According to local authorities, at least
      two people were killed and 15 injured.

      - Orbán''s party has ordered new billboards on which caricatures of Zelensky
      and opposition leader Magyar hatch from eggs side by side, dominated by the
      headline "Like eggs to eggs".

      - At least two of the commanders of Ukraine''s 110th Mechanised Brigade, Colonel
      Serhiy Zakharevich and Dmitro Romaniuk, were killed in a recent Russian airstrike
      on the town of Hulyai Pole.

      - Rutte said that "Lavrov has been foreign minister perhaps since the birth
      of Jesus Christ, and in all that time nothing worthy of attention has come out
      of his mouth".

      - The Ukrainian drones hit a Russian plant that produces not only resources
      but also fuses for bombs and drones, Energia near Lipetsk.

      - Russian drones hit a military commissariat in Poltava. At least two people
      died and others are injured.

      - Another British volunteer, drone pilot Ben Burgess, was killed in the Sumy
      region two weeks ago.

      - A fire broke out at a Russian gunpowder factory near Tambov. Three workers
      died.

      - Ukrainian drones destroyed a Russian ammunition depot in occupied Khartsyzsk
      near Donetsk.

      - Belgium and Turkey officially joined the drone coalition for Ukraine.

      soldiers/mercenaries. They say that this puts their lives at risk, as North
      Korea is threatening the soldiers with death for having allowed themselves to
      be captured. Shouldn''t the UN be more interested in what the North Koreans
      and Chinese are doing in Ukrainian captivity? What adds to the bizarreness of
      the whole report is the fact that a drone video of the Russians killing another
      Ukrainian prisoner of war appeared on the networks at the same time. This time
      by tying him up, strapping him to a motorbike and dragging him hundreds of metres
      along a dirt road at high speed.

      - The White House has confirmed that it has halted the delivery of key military
      equipment to Ukraine, such as Stinger missiles, PAC-3 missiles for Patriot systems,
      AIM-7 missiles, missiles for HIMARS systems, and 155 mm artillery ammunition.
      According to a White House spokeswoman, this is in line with Trump''s "America
      first" policy. The Kremlin has openly welcomed the US move.

    desc: 'Tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan are growing by leaps and bounds.
      Relations have been strained for some time, not only over the downing of a civilian
      plane by Russian air defence forces, but apparently the last straw for the Azeris
      was a series of raids in Russia targeting Azeri immigrants, in which two of
      them died. In response, Azerbaijan raided Sputnik''s local offices and detained
      at least two alleged Russian FSB spies - Sputnik managers Igor Kartavich and
      Yevgeny Belousov. Russia decided to escalate the situation further and demonstratively
      detained two businessmen - leaders of the Azerbaijani diaspora. In response,
      Azerbaijan then detained dozens more alleged Russian drug traffickers and, in
      the spirit of classic Russian propaganda, paraded them handcuffed in front of
      cameras. Russia, in turn, today arrested the head of the Azerbaijani mafia in
      Yekaterinburg, Shahin Shikhlynsky. Now two more pieces of information, not yet
      officially confirmed, are circulating: the first is that Azerbaijan is reportedly
      planning to close all Russian-language schools in the country and switch to
      teaching only in its own language. The second is that Azerbaijan, Armenia and
      Turkey are reportedly preparing a treaty on international cooperation on the
      Zangezur corridor, which would de facto mean that the Russians would lose any
      influence over it. Traditionally, Russian propagandists immediately began hectoring
      the Russians to attack Azerbaijan. And that''s what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid05ztSVSyaiBvC7cHgEGtkHBJCQCm7n3bkByF8yJ6zhaXookowunU3ibpR924HnZPCl):

      the side of evil, turned their backs on fundamental values, and traded collaboration
      with their enemies for a short-term sense of security. Your current elected

      in Florida right in the heart of Everglades National Park. It will be located
      outdoors in the area of a former airport and will largely consist of canvas
      tents. Locals call the facility "Alligator Alcatraz".

      - Lindsey Graham says Trump has agreed to pass his bill for tougher sanctions
      on Russian energy and related exports. For example, the bill would impose tariffs
      of 500% on all goods from countries that buy Russian oil and gas.

      - Russia still owns around five hundred Boeing and Airbus aircraft, which it

      for example, on projects in Hungary - lifted, according to Treasury Department
      documents.

      Following the strike, the power supply to the entire airport area was cut off.

      - Lavrov said that increasing the defense budget among NATO countries will lead
      to the collapse of the alliance. In other words, it is the right move and it
      will strengthen the alliance.

      - The Czech company Leseft International reportedly supplies Russia with components
      used in the production of missiles and cruise missiles.

      - Kremlin spokesman Peskov accused the United States and Ukraine of stalling
      further rounds of peace talks.

    desc: 'Putin has let it be known that Russia plans to cut defence spending next
      year and then cut it again the following year, while Europe is increasing its
      defence spending. In his view, this clearly shows who is preparing for aggressive
      action, and it is not Russia. First of all, there is certainly no doubt about
      who the aggressor is - it is whoever invades foreign sovereign states, or Russia.
      Secondly, if Russia says it will cut defence spending, there are two possibilities:
      Either it is a sheer lie (or at least demagoguery), or it will actually reduce
      spending, but in that case certainly not because it wants to, but because, due
      to its poor economic situation, it will simply have to in order to protect the
      Russian economy from the imminent collapse that Russian economists and government
      experts themselves are increasingly talking about. But in the end, it does not
      matter whether this is true. What will be far more important is how Russian
      propaganda exploits this claim to further destabilise the West from within with
      the help of local collaborators. The information will certainly be readily added
      to the Russian fifth column''s "argumentative" toolkit in the coming weeks.
      And you can bet that the argument à la "why should we increase spending when
      Russia is cutting it" will now be a ubiquitous evergreen among the collaborators

      away from a Russian court with an 8-year prison sentence for "spreading fake
      news about the Russian military." This makes it all the more disgusting when
      the biggest "defenders of free speech" in the Czech Republic are also the biggest
      disseminators of Russian propaganda.

      a convinced admirer of the Soviet Union, years earlier. Two options were reportedly
      on the table: the use of an FPV drone or a sniper rifle. But Ukrainian intelligence
      foiled the operation in time.

      - According to the Ukrainians, the Russians began adding a thick flammable substance

      place in the Sumy region. However, it cannot be said that the Russians are doing
      very well here. Russian channels on Telegram reported that Ukrainian forces
      liberated Andriyivka after the Russians unsuccessfully tried to reinforce the
      garrison there. Russian soldiers from the 810th Brigade reportedly suffered
      heavy casualties, and the platoon-sized group that survived the clashes was
      captured. In general, the entire offensive in this direction has been met with
      disproportionately heavy losses on the Russian side to the extent that the Russian
      troops have been able to advance, thanks in part to the precision work of the
      Ukrainian air force, which the Russians say has greatly improved its accuracy

    detail: '- NATO has cancelled planned meetings with the Ukrainian delegation at
      the upcoming NATO summit. The reason for this is said to be that the United
      States has completely cut the planned agenda, which will be shorter overall
      and will not even include a joint communiqué from the participating countries.

      - The North Atlantic alliance has reportedly completed testing of systems that
      are supposed to be able to intercept and shoot down Russian attack drones. Ukraine
      could receive the systems later this year.

      - Ukrainians hit a Russian fuel train near Tokmak in the occupied Zaporizhzhya
      region. In the last drone overflight, it was evident that at least 12 carriages
      were burned after the attack.

      - The United States conducted airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear installations.
      In response, the Yemeni army announced on its channels that it would enter the
      war alongside Iran.

      - Putin said that if Ukraine wants to avoid further conflict, it should recognise
      the results of the rigged referendums in the occupied territories.

      - Ukrainian intelligence is teaching Ukrainian youth how to recognize Russian
      influence operations and not be recruited for domestic terrorist attacks.

      - A 17-year-old teenager was killed in a Russian airstrike on Slavyansk. The
      airstrike damaged 32 houses, 4 apartment buildings and dozens of vehicles on
      the streets.

      - According to a 2023 poll, 63% of Russians view the dictator Stalin in a positive
      light. By comparison, in Ukraine, only 4% of people do.

      - Lukashenko had his former challenger, Tsikhanousky, released from prison along
      with a dozen other political prisoners.

      - Germany and Canada will fund Ukrainian drones - interceptors capable of shooting
      down Russian kamikaze drones.

      - North Korea has begun construction of its largest weapons plant to date. It
      covers an area of more than 5 hectares.

      - Russia''s Shipunov weapons plant had to stop production completely after the
      Ukrainian drone strikes.

      - Zelensky asks partner states to allocate just 0.25% of GDP to help Ukraine.

      - Hungary''s referendum on Ukraine''s admission to the EU had a record... non-participation.

      of Staff Sergio Gor is actually named Sergei Gorokhovsky and is probably lying
      about his background. "Sergio" claims to have been born in Malta, but there
      are no official records of him there. "Sergio" came to the United States in
      1999 and his acquaintances believe he was born in a country of the former Soviet
      Union, as evidenced by the fact that "Sergio" allegedly used a password in his
      mailbox in the past that was identical to passwords on other mail on sites with
      the Russian domain ".ru". Meanwhile, "Sergio" has been working with Trump for
      years, as well as with another Republican, Senator Rand Paul, whom he accompanied
      on a 2018 state visit to... yes, you guessed it... Moscow. Trump''s team has
      refused to comment on the findings, while "Sergio" himself is trying to silence
      any people who reported on his irregularities by threatening a possible lawsuit.
      He has even set up a public collection for legal representation, in which he
      calls on people to help him "fight for freedom of speech". Where did we hear

    detail: '- The Russians have copied Ukrainian tactics with explosives planted
      in motorbikes, bicycles or parcels, only they are not targeting the top brass
      of the Ukrainian army, but anyone connected to the army in any way - individual
      soldiers, volunteers, businessmen and others. The aim is not so much to eliminate
      a particular person as to unleash terror, create an atmosphere of fear and paralyse
      the Ukrainian resistance from within.

      - According to Ukrainian military intelligence, Russia currently has around
      1 950 different missiles and cruise missiles and around 6 000 Shahed kamikaze
      drones in its warehouses. Russia is said to currently produce around 195 missiles/shot
      per month and around 170 drones per day. Most of the parts come from China,
      while the rest are Western parts that Russia imports through various third country
      intermediaries.

      - Drones are not a Czech specific. The Juliusz Słowacki Theatre had to move
      the Ukrainian flag, which it put up in solidarity, to the entrance hall because
      it had repeatedly become a target of vandals. Inside, it will certainly be safe
      from desolates. People like that don''t go to the theatre.

      - Russian military intelligence has released a wiretap from a Russian radio
      which shows that a Russian soldier nicknamed "Brelok" killed and ate a colleague
      at the front for two weeks before being killed himself.

      - The Russians have released a new game on the Steam platform, Squad 22: ZOV,
      where you can control soldiers during the occupation of the Donbass in 2014
      or the conquest of Avdiivka in 2024.

      - Russian police arrested a Russian YouTuber right on the street who ripped
      a Russian flag off the wall of his room in exchange for a 1,000 ruble donation
      from viewers.

      - Putin has said that he sees Russians and Ukrainians as one nation and therefore
      considers all of Ukraine part of the Russian Federation.

      - Russia launched an airstrike last night using missiles and drones, with the
      main target being the oil infrastructure in Kremenchuk.

      - Ukrainian drones repeatedly hit the site of a plant in Tula that produces
      missile systems.

      - Putin said that "Israel is now almost a Russian-speaking country and Moscow
      takes this into account".

      - Putin described warnings by Russian economists of impending stagnation as
      exaggerated.

      - Ukraine has started line production of small radars to detect drones.

      - Keith Kellogg has arrived in Belarus.

      that Russia''s economic situation is so alarming that Russia faces a fate similar
      to that of the Soviet Union, as it may easily become unable to provide a decent
      living for its people in the near future. In parallel with this, the head of
      the Russian Central Bank announced that Russia''s potential for economic growth
      had been exhausted, because all the reserves that kept the economy going had
      been exhausted. The head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs
      admitted that many companies were on the verge of bankruptcy. The US ISW recently
      noted that Russia''s strategy now rests entirely on the assumption that Western
      support will collapse, forcing Ukraine to capitulate. This is also why Russia
      is desperately ramping up all its propaganda and other hybrid attacks. It obviously

      behind bars for a crazy 22 years in yet another staged trial. In the past, she
      set up a humanitarian organisation to evacuate civilians and animals from shelled
      areas, and also helped search for missing persons and distribute medicine to
      frontline villages. The court in Belgorod based the entire accusation on a social
      media post in which she was supposed to call for support for the ZSU. Officially,
      Russia accuses her of "treason", "financing terrorism" and "activities against
      the security of the Russian Federation".

      - Russian MP Davankov told reporters that his political party had submitted
      an official request to the foreign ministry for Elon Musk to be granted political
      asylum. Davankov even claims that Musk himself has requested it. We may say
      that Musk is not pro-Russian, but the Russians obviously think otherwise.

      - According to Ukrainian analyst Yizhak, Russia will hit Ukraine with a massive
      missile and drone strike around June 24-25 to put pressure on NATO countries
      ahead of the upcoming summit in The Hague.

      - Peskov said he saw no reason for Russia to seek a ceasefire when it has a
      strategic advantage and is steadily advancing deeper into Ukrainian territory.
      So... Russia doesn''t want peace?

      - Russia is reportedly ramping up production of Shahed drones considerably and
      even building another production facility. So it will soon reportedly be common
      for several hundred drones to fly into Ukraine every single night.

      who are actively involved in the war with Ukraine should be banned from entering

      that Trump had any involvement in the India-Pakistan ceasefire deal. He said
      all negotiations were exclusively between the two sides in the conflict and
      the United States was not involved at any level. India has reportedly not asked
      for U.S. mediation and has no plans to ever change that.

      - Russian Finance Minister Reshetnikov warned that Russia is "on the verge of
      a recession." In fact, it is probably long past the brink. Indeed, official
      statistics have long been falsified, and Russia''s GDP is being mightily stimulated
      by the production of weapons and equipment, but these are going nowhere - they
      will simply be destroyed in the war with Ukraine.

      - Russian media Verstka and Vazhnee Istorii revealed that Russian oligarch Deripaska
      trafficked underage girls between 2018-2019 under the pretext of organising
      beauty contests. He then sold them for prostitution to various Middle Eastern
      sheikhs, crime bosses and political leaders.

      - According to the Telegraph, nationalists in Putin''s inner circle are pushing
      Putin to officially declare war on Ukraine. This, they say, would allow him
      to mobilise the entire Russian population, escalate missile strikes and potentially
      use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine.

      - In an interview with CNN, Russia''s ambassador to Britain, Kelin, denied that
      Russia had lost a million troops. But he also confirmed that Russia mobilizes
      around 50-60,000 people every month. So why the size of the Russian army is
      not changing, he did not explain.

      - Putin said he was ready to meet with Zelensky "if the West stops pushing Zelensky
      to go to war". But at the same time, he again said that he did not consider
      Zelensky to be the legitimate president of Ukraine.

      - Lukashenko, because of the country''s potato shortage, called on young people
      to "throw away their iPhones and go dig two rows of potatoes each, because nothing

      pistol.

      - Slovak police reportedly attempted to arrest former defence minister Jaroslav
      Nada on suspicion of corruption in providing ammunition to Ukraine.

      - Residents of the Orenburg region in Russia claim that Ukrainian sabotage groups
      operating in the area came from Kazakhstan.

      - The Chechen Prime Minister has reported that Chechnya has already spent around
      half a billion dollars on the war with Ukraine.

      - There has been another prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia. Most
      of them were captured in the first year of the war.

      - The Finnish Parliament voted to withdraw from the agreement banning the use
      of anti-personnel landmines.

      - The Saudi Crown Prince compared the Iranian regime, an ally of Russia, to
      Nazi Germany.

      - The US Congress postponed a vote on new sanctions against Russia until July.

      and one storage area were also damaged. However, videos also captured the impact
      of at least six drones on market stalls in one of the squares. Farmers'' sausages
      are probably also a legitimate military target according to the Russians. And

    detail: '- Israeli airstrikes reveal the utter helplessness of Russian-made air
      defence systems against modern Western machines. Israel has been systematically
      destroying Iranian planes, helicopters, airfields, missile launchers and the
      air defence systems themselves virtually unopposed for several days now, and
      the only confirmed loss on the Israeli side at the moment is a Hermes 900 propeller
      reconnaissance/attack drone. This, as in the past, could have a major impact
      on Russia''s ability to export its weapons abroad.

      - A soldier from the 63rd Mechanized Brigade, which is defending Lyman, reported
      that the number of Russian prisoners has skyrocketed. The Russians are reportedly
      surrendering in such numbers that it is difficult to find locations for new
      prisoners. The reason for this is said to be the poor logistical situation on
      the Russian side, which has left some units lacking even basic items such as
      food and water.

      - The Ukrainian 1st Assault Battalion, which is part of the 225th Assault Regiment
      of the ZSU, carried out a counter-attack near Andriyivka, during which it managed
      to infiltrate the command post of the Russian army''s 30th Motorized Artillery
      Regiment and eliminate its commander, Major Andrei Yartsev, in close combat.

      - Zelensky was due to meet Trump at the G7 summit in Canada. But he left the
      summit early. The Americans subsequently did not support the G7 joint declaration,
      saying it was "too anti-Russian" and could undermine peace talks with Putin.

      - Merz responded to Trump''s suggestion that Russia return to the G8: "We don''t
      sit with warlords and war criminals in this format, which is why Putin doesn''t
      have a seat at the negotiating table here."

      - Trump yesterday lured viewers on his networks to the "sensational" news he
      was about to unleash. He told the world that he was going to add flagpoles to
      two sides of the White House. He called the whole event his "gift to America."

      - According to Zelensky, the Russians have extensively upgraded the original
      Iranian Shahed drones and are now moving some of their production to North Korea
      out of range of the Ukrainian drones.

      - In the recent Russian airstrike on Kiev, the Fahenheit garment factory, which
      until now also produced military uniforms and other clothing, was hit.

      - According to Reuters, Trump''s negotiator Kellogg plans to visit Belarus in
      the coming days to meet with Lukashenko.

      - A Taliban delegation arrived in St. Petersburg for an "International Economic
      Forum" hosted by Russia.

      - Five more bodies were discovered in the ruins of houses in Kiev. This brings
      the death toll to 21.

      - Canada announced a new military aid package worth around 2 billion Canadian
      dollars.

      - All NATO countries will meet their commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence
      this year, according to Rutte.

      - One of the victims of the recent Russian airstrike on Kiev is a US citizen.

      - Ukraine has deployed new French MV-25 OSKAR drones.

      - The Russian post office has started delivering packages to North Korea.

      and other cities. In total, 440 kamikaze drones and 32 missiles/shots were in
      the air. According to Ukrainian officials, a total of 27 buildings were targeted,
      including two post office branches, grain freight trains, elements of the power

      Ukrainian children for captured Russian soldiers during the negotiations in
      Istanbul. The Ukrainian delegation reportedly brought a list of 400 children
      to the talks and demanded their immediate return home. The Russians were to
      reply that they would provide no more than ten children (thereby admitting their
      abduction, NB). To this the Ukrainian delegation replied that the Russians had
      abducted 20 000 children, to which the Russians replied that ''not 20 000, a
      few hundred at most'' (thus again confirming their abduction, n.b.). According
      to Zelensky, everything is in the official minutes of the meeting. Zelensky
      described the Russians'' attitude as completely incomprehensible and in complete
      contravention of all international law. And in the same spirit will be the next

    detail: '- Ukraine repatriated the remains of another 1 245 soldiers. In total,
      the bodies of 6,057 defenders have returned home in the current exchanges. The
      high number is primarily due to the fact that the creeping Russian advance has
      made it impossible for months, in some places years, for the recovery of bodies
      from the battlefield to take place at all. These are therefore the remains of
      soldiers who have fallen at any time in the last three years. The Ukrainian
      coroners also complain that the Russians deliberately make it difficult to identify
      the bodies by mutilating them before handing them over, placing parts of the
      bodies in several different bags where they are mixed with others, and, last
      but not least, by handing over even the bodies of their own soldiers to Ukraine
      in order to inflate official statistics so that they do not have to admit losses
      and can continue to list the fallen soldiers as ''missing'' on their own records.
      Ukrainian intelligence also warns that the Russians are planning a massive disinformation
      campaign involving fake death certificates of fallen soldiers in the coming
      weeks.

      - Hungary is rocked by another scandal in the Orbán government: Orbán''s "security
      advisor" Georg Spöttle, who for years has been spreading almost all pro-Russian
      propaganda disguised as "military analysis", is directly directed by Russian
      GRU officer Oleg Smirnov, according to new revelations. Smirnov was formerly
      a military attaché at the Russian embassy in Prague and later in Budapest. Spöttle
      himself openly declared in 2022 that he supported Russia in its war with Ukraine.

      - Zelensky reported that immediately after Trump''s recent phone call with Putin,
      the Americans contacted the Ukrainians and asked them to stop attacking Russia''s
      energy infrastructure. That same night, Russia launched a massive airstrike
      on Kremenchuk, targeting the power plants and electricity substations there.
      Zelensky described this as a complete spit in the face of the entire international
      community by the Russians.

      - Russia has named a new condition for ending the war: Ukraine must, among other
      things, destroy all stocks of weapons and ammunition provided by the West under
      international supervision. Russia is therefore continuing with its usual negotiating
      tactics, as described in the past by Kaja Kallas, for example: Demand as much
      as possible so that even a minor concession is ultimately a victory for Russia.

      - The commander of the Ukrainian forces near Siversk, one of the targets of
      the Russian offensive, reports that the Russians have been using powerful chemical
      weapons, modified to cause extremely rapid damage to lungs and other tissues,
      against Ukrainian positions for three weeks straight.

      - Demchenko, the commander of the Ukrainian border guards, says the number and
      intensity of Russian attacks in the Sumy region have dropped precipitously.
      He says the Russians have switched back to the tactic of attacking small infantry
      squads with minimal regard for potential casualties.

      - According to Politico, Poland and the Baltic states are preparing intensively
      for a Russian attack: they are building underground shelters and hospitals,
      buying bulletproof vests and ballistic helmets in bulk, arming themselves and
      building defensive lines.

      - Putin''s adviser Vladimir Medinsky claimed at a lecture that the Poles in
      1939 did not see the arrival of the Russians as an invasion. This is supposedly
      a modern interpretation of contemporary Poles.

      - A Russian civilian Superjet-100 had to make an emergency landing at Vnukovo
      airport shortly after takeoff because it lost one of its two engines.

      - Latvia has detained pro-Russian MP Roslikovs on suspicion of collaborating
      with Russia against Latvia''s interests.

      - Zelensky''s popularity plummeted in May. Despite all this, 65% of Ukrainians
      trust him, according to the poll.

      - Trump has said he is open to Putin mediating peace talks between Israel and
      Iran.

      - U.S. negotiators canceled a planned meeting with the Russian delegation to
      resume embassy operations.

    desc: 'In the United States, there has been what most commentators are calling
      "Trump''s birthday military parade". While Trump claims to have organised the
      parade to mark the 250th anniversary of the US military, it is actually quite
      obvious that he wanted to emulate the Eastern dictators he admires for their
      projection of power and put on a parade for his birthday yesterday. Except that
      Trump probably forgot that the North Korean and Chinese militaries have units
      that do nothing but practice marching and formations for grandiose parades.
      Also that in dictatorships, such parades have mandatory extras. So commentators
      couldn''t help but notice that instead of a majestic march, the US soldiers
      paraded through the streets as if they were on a parade (though there is also
      speculation that defiance of Trump might be behind this), the onlookers were
      thick as thieves, and every part of the parade looked amateurish, even comical
      at times. For example, the three soldiers who were supposed to represent drone
      pilots, with one of them controlling the drone that flew above them, while the
      other carried the drone overhead in his hand, as if he was just playing drone
      pilot. But there were crowds in the streets after all. Just not at Trump''s
      birthday parade, but at the "No Kings" protests, which millions of people across
      the US attended, and which were directed against Trump. The crown of all this,
      however, was given by the US Department of Defense, which posted a graphic on
      its social media profiles to mark American Flag Day, which included a tricolour
      in the colours of the Russian flag. To clarify, the United States has no official
      tricolour and the various patriotic ribbons usually have the colours in a different
      order. So this is either incredible dilettantism on the part of Trump''s Secretary
      of Defense or very bad intent. And it also happened [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid05j3PYRBqwzCTy8GvtxtVD1kmt1UQiP9u54KbJYLMWmsKxH54oeTxY1U3J3WrAgtAl):

      Operation Spiderweb in its recent strike on targets in Iran: It drove trucks
      with FPV drones into the vicinity of targets, which took off at a key moment
      and struck in swarms at Iranian air and missile bases, air defense sites, and
      other targets. So far, no official source has confirmed or refuted these claims.
      But it would not be surprising. Operation Spider Web will go down in history
      as one of the most successful subversive actions in history, and it can be assumed

      \ that the bombers have to spend literally a full day (23 hours) in the air\
      \ to launch a missile into Ukraine and return to their bases.\n- President Pavel\

      \ of war alternating with periods of peace as most of the civilized world does.\
      \ Indeed, Russia itself describes this approach in its own military doctrine.\n\
      - Ukrainian counter-attacks continue in the Sumy region. According to Syrian,\
      \ they have managed to push the Russians out of other villages, including Yablonivka.\
      \ President Zelensky confirmed the information and said that \"the Russians\

      .\n- According to the UN report, Ukrainian refugees have brought $88.7 billion\
      \ into the Polish treasury since the beginning of the invasion, while drawing\
      \ only $10.9 billion from it. Thus, Poland has earned eight times the value\
      \ of the aid it has provided in taking in refugees.  \n- Trump said at the press\
      \ conference that Putin doesn't understand how it is possible that Russia fought\
      \ on the same side as the US in World War II, yet the whole world hates it today,\
      \ while people love Germany and Japan today.\n- Poland's Sejm ruled that pro-Russian\
      \ MEP Grzegorz Braun will be banned from entering the Sejm building after Braun\
      \ destroyed an ongoing educational exhibition on LGBT issues.\n- The North Atlantic\
      \ Treaty Organisation will monitor the eastern front in Ukraine using AI-enabled\
      \ satellites. It can be assumed that the findings will be shared with Ukraine.\n\

    detail: '- The Russian military blog Transformer has published a lengthy interview
      with a military medic who, under a pseudonym, describes the desperate state
      of military medicine. He says most procedures have not changed since the 1970s,
      and Russia dramatically cut its budget for military medicine in 2008, deeming
      it redundant. The only training that new conscripts receive in this regard is
      a short demonstration on how to tie a tourniquet, but these are often Chinese-made
      and burst the first time they are used. As a result, the Russian army in Ukraine
      is said to have a disproportionately high mortality rate among the wounded.
      Medik illustrates this with a model situation: a group of ten soldiers is injured
      by an artillery shell. One dies instantly, two others die within half an hour
      from severe injuries. Three die within an hour, although they might have survived
      if their colleagues had known how to give them first aid. Another three cannot
      walk on their own as a result of their injuries and usually die within 4-5 hours
      unless they can be evacuated. And they usually don''t. The other two have to
      try to walk 5-10 km to the nearest infirmary on their own. The medic therefore
      estimates that while in Afghanistan there were 4 wounded survivors for every
      one killed, in Ukraine there are two dead for every one survivor.

      - German intelligence warns that there are doubts in the highest Russian circles
      as to whether Article 5 of the NATO treaty is currently operational. The Russians
      could therefore repeat the scenario with the "little green men" in the Baltic
      States or on the Finnish border. The head of German intelligence believes that
      conflict with Russia is already inevitable, and the longer Europe is unwilling
      to admit it, the less prepared it will be.

      - Ukrainian military intelligence claims that the Russians are now producing
      around 5,000 kamikaze Shahed drones every month, with 2,700 being real attack
      drones and the rest being decoy targets. According to Ukrainian intelligence,
      Russia also plans to assist North Korea in launching its own production of Shahed
      drones, which could then support Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.

      - In the town of Tyotkino in Russia''s Kursk region, Ukrainians captured Lieutenant
      Commander Alexei Mamaev, a former commander of one of Russia''s anti-submarine
      ships in the Caspian Fleet who now serves in the 165th Ground Forces Battalion.
      This tells us something about the real personnel situation in the Russian army.

      - To further illustrate the Russian claim of "protecting the Russian-speaking
      population": in the current prisoner exchange, only 23-year-old Valery, who
      was captured in Mariupol in 2022, made it home. He then spent more than 3 years
      in 8 different prisons and only learned Ukrainian there - from his fellow prisoners.

      - The North Korean cruiser, which recently sank during launching, was towed
      to the port of Rajin near the border with Russia. Analysts believe that Russia
      will assist the North Koreans in repairing and restoring it to service.

      - According to the German press, the activity of unknown drones in the Baltic
      Sea off the coast of Germany is increasing. European intelligence agencies reportedly
      believe that at least some of them are launched by cargo ships belonging to
      the Russian shadow fleet.

      - Kadyrov''s men are filmed firing RPGs at residential buildings in Suji. It''s
      worth remembering that Russian "separatists" did the same thing in 2014 in the
      Donbas, and subsequently accused the Ukrainian army of shelling civilians.

      - A group of Russian MPs - in response to Renault''s cooperation in the production
      of drones for Ukraine - are proposing that the car company''s logo be put on
      a par with banned Nazi symbols.

      - The head of the Russian negotiating team, Medinsky, has said that if Ukraine
      or the West tries to retake the occupied territories of Ukraine, then Russia
      will unleash nuclear war and the whole world will burn.

      - Sergei Ryabkov, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Lavrov, said that the war
      in Ukraine will not end until NATO withdraws all its troops from the Baltic
      republics.

      - Errol Musk waxed poetic on camera during Dugin''s Future 2025 conference about
      how beautiful Moscow is and referred to it as the capital of the world.

      - U.S. prosecutors have charged a Russian cryptocurrency entrepreneur with money
      laundering and helping Russia evade sanctions.

      - Kiev experienced another heavy airstrike using missiles and kamikaze drones.
      St. Sophia Cathedral also suffered damage.

      - Ukrainian drones again hit a Russian Shahed drone factory in distant Tatarstan.

      - In an overnight raid, one of the Russian drones hit and damaged a maternity
      hospital in Odessa.

      - Russia has officially recognised Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan.

      as quite successful. It managed to neutralize 464 out of 499 Russian kamikaze

    title: Monday
    year: 9 June 2025
    detail: '- Since there is still no solid evidence to corroborate yesterday''s
      editorial about the Russian equipment hitting the echelon, it is fair to assume
      that the report is a deliberate duck by Russia. All the information cited, after
      all, came mainly from Russian channels. Why would Russia lie about an incident
      that shows them in a bad light? Simply because if they can show one sensational
      report to be fake, they can then effectively cast doubt on another - for example,
      the real Operation Spiderweb. Remember, the primary goal of Russian propaganda
      is not to disseminate information that portrays Russia in a good light, but
      to flood the information space with contradictory information so that people
      resign themselves to the search for truth and accept the idea that "everyone
      is lying" and "there will be a little truth in everything."

      - The first phase of the prisoner exchange, which was agreed at the last meeting
      of the Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Turkey, is currently under way.
      Among others, some of the soldiers who defended Mariupol in the first year of
      the invasion have returned home. This will be followed next week by the repatriation
      of the bodies of the fallen - those who were taken to the Ukrainian border by
      the Russians two days ago to be photographed and filmed for propaganda material
      for the disinformation claiming that Ukraine is refusing to collect the bodies.

      - The Russians have announced a plan to move some 50,000 children from the occupied
      territories of Ukraine to their camps in Russia for "Russification". The Russians
      have thus openly admitted that they are abducting Ukrainian children."

      - More and more military equipment is flowing from Russia to the border with
      the Sumy region. The Russians have moved some of it from Crimea and the occupied
      part of Kherson region. So it is obvious that the Russians will want to make
      the most of the current breakthrough and move the front line within striking
      distance of Sumy.

      - The Ukrainians hit and destroyed a Russian infantry base in Rylsk near Kursk.
      The building that was hit was used as a cultural center/soccer hall before the
      war. However, according to the site, it has not hosted any action since June
      2024. Since then it has been used by the Russian army.

      - Zelensky claims that Trump had not only the missile fuzes promised back in
      the Biden administration, but also 20,000 smaller missiles designed to shoot
      down Russian drones, diverted to the Middle East.

      - According to documents from the Russian Ministry of Education, 3 900 schools
      in the Russian Federation have no sewage connection, 3 400 have no running water
      and 3 500 have no central heating.

      - In the Black Sea, Ukrainian naval drones used machine guns and FPV drones
      to attack Russian special forces who had conducted a landing on an oil platform.

      - Ukrainian drones repeatedly struck Russian VNIIR-Pokrok and ABS Electro factories
      in Chuvashia, where components for Russian electronic warfare systems are manufactured.

      - Ukrainian drones attacked the Russian Savasleyka airbase near Nizhny Novgorod.
      Witnesses say the airfield was hit, but the extent of the damage is not yet
      known.

      - In a recent strike on Russian Iskander missile systems, the group''s commander,
      Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Podozerov of the 26th Missile Artillery Brigade, was
      also killed.

      - NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is calling for the alliance to increase
      the number of air defence systems in its arsenal to five times that number because
      of the threat from Russia.

      - Renault will manufacture drones for the Ukrainian military''s needs, at an
      emerging plant right in eastern Ukraine.

      - Fico said Slovakia will veto anti-Russian sanctions if they threaten Slovakia''s
      national interests.

      - Ukrainian drones hit a Russian gunpowder factory in Kazan. A massive fire
      broke out after the strike.

      - Lavrov accused Britain of "100% helping Ukraine with terrorist attacks against
      Russia".

      - Another purveyor of Russian propaganda, businessman Jeffrey Sachs, is also
      heading to Moscow for the conference.

      - Israel has reportedly handed over several Patriot systems to Ukraine.

    desc: 'Operation Cobweb has a very worthy sequel. An echelon carrying tanks, armoured
      vehicles and other military material and equipment was completely destroyed
      in the occupied territory of eastern Ukraine. That in itself is fantastic news.
      What is most amazing, however, is the way in which the action was carried out.
      The Russians hitched the trains of equipment to a locomotive which, in addition
      to them, was pulling several wagons intended for transporting grain from the
      occupied territories. The Ukrainians first hit the locomotive, causing the train
      to stop. According to witnesses, the lids of the grain wagons were opened and
      FPV drones began to fly out of them. In addition to the locomotive, 13 battle
      tanks, 7 guns, 103 armoured personnel carriers and other infantry vehicles,
      as well as ten fuel tankers with a total volume of about 170 000 gallons of
      fuel were subsequently hit and mostly completely destroyed. Russian military
      bloggers are completely deranged and are beginning to look for the culprits
      in the ranks of their own military and intelligence. And there''s more of this
      going on [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0TqAYBrfAHk9TfAtEFub5fwpKNVWX8DEpJRY12YcoFEJGuEMthDzFYKexR8tNh5Rzl):

    title: Sunday
    year: 8 June 2025
    detail: '- Russian investigators have released details of a recent incident in
      which a passenger train crashed into the wreckage of a bridge previously blown
      up by Ukrainian partisans. According to the timeline, the bridge collapsed at
      10:20 a.m., just after a freight train passed underneath it (which was probably
      the target of the action, note). The passenger train did not hit the bridge
      until an incredible 30 minutes later, around 10:50. All of this points either
      to incredible dilettantism, with nobody being able to do anything to stop the
      passing trains for half an hour, or worse, perhaps the Russians deliberately
      let the passenger train crash into the bridge so that they could then go on
      to indignantly rave in the media about "Ukrainian terrorism".

      - The Washington Post reported that this February, DOGE members installed a
      Starlink terminal on the roof of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, part
      of the White House complex, without prior permission. The terminal reportedly
      bypassed existing systems designed to prevent data leaks and cyberattacks. As
      a result, White House security services could not monitor the connection, creating
      a potential risk of sensitive data leakage or outside interference. A White
      House staffer revealed this to reporters.

      - The Russians have transported the bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers in refrigerated
      trucks to the border several times in recent days, where they have lamented
      to the cameras that the Ukrainians have no interest in their fallen. Meanwhile,
      the date for the exchange of prisoners and bodies has not yet been agreed and
      is thus just another cynical propaganda PR stunt by the Russians.

      - The newly elected Polish President, Nawrocki, has stated that it is not in
      the interests of the EU Member States at the moment for Ukraine to be admitted
      to the Union in an accelerated procedure. But he also praised Ukraine''s struggle
      against Russian imperialism, adding that continued support for Ukraine is in
      Poland''s strategic and geopolitical interest.

      - In recent days, the Russians have again advanced in the Sumy region, but also
      north of Kupyansk, where they have managed to extend their bridgehead beyond
      the Oskil River. The Ukrainians have managed to slightly push back the Russians
      in the south of Pokrovsk. But even in the Donetsk region, the Russians have
      shifted the front slightly and continue to press the Ukrainian defences.

      - Sweden is facing a series of sabotage in which unknown perpetrators have already
      damaged around three dozen mobile signal transmitters. In all cases, cabling
      has been cut and key elements of the transmitters damaged. At the same time,
      the perpetrators did not steal anything.

      - Petr Pavel warned that the conflict in Ukraine has similarities with the events
      that preceded the Second World War and appealed to world leaders not to allow
      the conflict to spread to the West.

      - Ukrainian missiles hit the Hydromash factory in occupied Melitopol, which
      the Russians use as a repair depot for military equipment.

      - Satellite images show the Russians hastily building protective features at
      a dozen military airfields across Russia after the Pavuchina operation.

      - Leaked documents show that the Russian FSB considers China a strategic enemy
      despite the apparent partnership between Russia and China.

      - In a recent Ukrainian strike near Bryansk, three Iskander-M missile launchers
      were destroyed and eight personnel were killed.

      - The Russians have again bombed civilian buildings in Kharkiv. At least 18
      people were injured and one woman in her 30s was killed.

      - The SBU detained two Russian collaborators who were planning to bomb a prosecutor
      in Dnipro.

      - Ukrainians hit a EuroChem factory in the Tula region that produces explosives
      for the Russian military.

      - Musk''s father Erol flew to Moscow for a conference organised by the fascist
      Dugin.

      - A Russian bitumen plant near the Lukoil refinery near the town of Kstovo burns
      down.

      - Disclaimer to today''s editorial - since there is still no solid evidence
      from the Ukrainian side and almost all of the report relies on information from
      the Russian section of Telegram, take it as unconfirmed for now. Many times
      in the past, the Russians have released some duck masquerading as a Ukrainian
      success story, only to spread it and then portray the Ukrainians as having to
      lie about their successes. Given the recent Operation Spiderweb, they would
      now have good reason to do so. Until the evidence emerges, take this report
      with a grain of salt.

      For four hours straight, the Russians hurled rockets, drones, glide bombs and
      artillery shells at the city. At least six people were killed and 17 others

    title: Saturday
    year: 7 June 2025
    detail: '- Russian propaganda is now trying to spread the disinformation that
      the Western intelligence services, especially the British MI6 and in various
      iterations the intelligence services of other countries, were actually behind
      Operation Spider''s Web. Of course, the use of information from some intelligence
      services of partner countries cannot be ruled out, but to claim that the action
      was carried out by Western intelligence services is absurd. In any case, the
      real point of such narratives is not to blame the West, but to deepen the perception
      of Ukrainians in the Russian population as incompetent ''little brothers'' who
      can do nothing on their own and therefore need protection and a firm hand in
      the form of Moscow.

      - The Russians have published several reports in recent days about how they
      managed to kill the perpetrators who were in the process of planning drone attacks
      on bases in Russia. But this is probably just a show for the domestic audience,
      so that Russian intelligence does not look so inept in front of its own people
      after a series of Ukrainian strikes. In fact, the videos that were supposed
      to prove the incidents look very staged.

      - The White House is reportedly pushing US senators to water down the upcoming
      new Russian sanctions bill, which has more than 80% support across senators
      from both parties. Trump is reportedly trying to change the wording from "will
      impose sanctions" to "may impose sanctions" so that the bill itself doesn''t
      commit to anything.

      - Belgium is solving a horrific double murder case in which a 46-year-old Ukrainian
      woman and her 6-year-old daughter were stabbed to death. The perpetrator subsequently
      set fire to the house in an attempt to cover his tracks. The family found refuge
      in Belgium three years ago. The husband and father of the victim are currently
      fighting in Ukraine in the ranks of the ZSU.

      - Russian propaganda classically claims that the Russian missiles that landed
      on civilian buildings in Lutsk actually hit "an underground bunker that housed
      a storage facility for 56 Storm Shadow missiles, 32 Patriot missiles and 53
      ATACMS missiles".

      - Trump claimed that Ukraine''s strike on Russian airports "gave Putin an excuse
      to bomb the whole place to pieces." I miss the days when municipal idiots didn''t
      make celebrities or - heaven forbid - presidents.

      - The Wagners have announced that they are pulling out completely from Mali,
      where they have previously suffered repeated heavy losses fighting the rebels
      there. Thus, another Russian private army will take over operations in the region:
      Afrika Korps. Yes, that''s what they really call themselves.

      - Russia claims that the drone attack on the Crimean bridge did not result in
      serious damage, but the fact is that since then, freight traffic and trains
      have not been allowed to cross the bridge, and the Russians have been regulating
      the volume of cars passing through.

      - Zelensky was responding to Trump''s stupid comment. According to him, Russia
      and Ukraine are not two kids fighting on the playground, but Russia is a murderer
      who came to the playground to kill.

      - The Ukrainians managed to shoot down a Russian Su-35 fighter jet over the
      Kursk region. According to Russian channels, the pilot managed to eject and
      survived the crash.

      - Czech MEP Dostál (Enough) and Slovak MEP Uhrík (LSNS/HR), in a word, collaborators,
      are on a state visit to Belarus.

      - The Ukrainian air defence forces shot down 94 out of 206 Russian kamikaze
      drones last night. Another 80 drones crashed.

      - Krzysztof Gorzelak, a Polish journalist who fought in the ranks of the International
      Legion, was killed at the front.

      - Ukraine announced that it has started mass production of its own ballistic
      missile with a 400kg warhead.

      - 2 people died on a beach in Odessa when a naval mine exploded next to them.

      - Ukraine and France will start joint production of FPV drones.

      drones. The Ukrainians managed to hit the aviation fuel depot at the Engels-2
      military airport near Saratov, resulting in a massive fire at the site. The
      military airfield at Diaghilevo near Ryazan was also hit. Bryansk reports that
      Ukrainian missiles destroyed a Russian air defence or rocket artillery site.
      In Belgorod, a courthouse where several staged trials of Ukrainian prisoners
      have taken place in the past was hit. In the Tambov region, the Pokrok factory
      producing parts for Russian aircraft and missiles came under attack. The Russian
      attack, in addition to several potentially strategic targets - such as the engine
      plant in Lutsk - was again primarily aimed at terrorising the civilian population.
      In total, 407 drones and 44 missiles/fire were flown into Ukraine (368 drones
      and 38 missiles did not reach their targets due to air defense and EW systems).
      Among others, apartment buildings, a clinic, a gymnasium, elements of energy
      infrastructure were hit. In Kiev, a drone landed in front of the entrance to
      the Dostoevsky Library and on the entrance to the metro. A hotel in Lutsk was
      also hit. Hotels are generally popular targets for Russians, as they often host
      foreign journalists, aid workers and other volunteers. This particular Motor
      Hotel, however, housed the Ukrainian national athletics team. It is only a miracle
      that no one was injured there. However, the firefighters who intervened in Kiev
      were not so lucky. 3 of them were killed trying to put out the fires that were
      starting as the attack was underway. And then there was [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02E4QAaci5F7NgqunDS8uDprH5qgjzaFye8s5Lc1DM1VrrkR9XZjxu81YDzN4exvNil):

    detail: '- The Russian search engine Yandex has started blurring satellite images
      on its maps in places where elements of Russian military infrastructure are
      located, including, for example, air defense sites. A side effect is that such
      locations now appear on maps as a fist in the eye, showing all visitors to the
      site at a glance where military installations are located, even though one might
      not have known it before.

      - The Russian command forbids its soldiers to move on the front in armoured
      vehicles without drone protection. But because the Russians don''t have enough
      jammers, the soldiers are dealing with this by installing dummy electronic systems
      on vehicles made from anything they can find, including pots, lava cans, boxes...

      - Trump has said that if Ukraine and Russia don''t come to an agreement soon,
      he''s prepared to impose tough sanctions, and he''s prepared to impose them
      on both warring countries. He also likened the ongoing war to two kids fighting
      on the playground, adding that sometimes it''s better to let them fight for
      a while before getting involved.

      - Zelensky''s chief of staff said that Russia is not seeking peace, but instead
      is intensively preparing for an ongoing war during which it will try to conquer
      all of Ukraine''s territory east of the Dnieper River and cut Ukraine off from
      the Black Sea.

      - There is another wave of popular Russian disinformation circulating on the
      internet, following the template of ''Zelensky bought an expensive property
      with Western money''. This time he was supposed to buy his mother a luxury apartment
      in the Burj Khalifa skyscraper.

      - The Russians released footage from their FPV drones in Kherson. In addition
      to attacking the civilian population as such, they are now also attacking the
      wind farms there.

      - According to the footage released by Ukraine, the raid on military targets
      near Bryansk was carried out by drones launched directly from Russian territory.

      - According to the Washington Post, Operation Spiderweb was just the beginning.
      Ukraine has reportedly set in motion other similar operations.

      - Another train derailed near Voronezh due to damaged tracks. No one was injured
      in the incident.

      - Russian channels warn that the Crimean Bridge is threatened by another wave
      of naval and underwater drones.

      - A mining platform used by the Russians as an observation post burns in the
      Black Sea.

      \ Moldovan intelligence estimates that Russia has already invested around 1%\
      \ of Moldova's GDP in hybrid operations and propaganda.\n- Russian Deputy Foreign\
      \ Minister Sergei Ryabkov assured the Russians that \"the planes hit by the\

      \ in the Middle East.\n- The Ukrainians managed to hit a Russian missile artillery\
      \ site near Bryansk, damaging several Iskander missile launchers in the process.\
      \  \n- The Russians hit a training site near Poltava, fortunately at a time\
      \ when almost no one was there, and so only a few soldiers were injured.\n-\
      \ Zelensky told Russia that if Ukraine is to resign from potential NATO membership,\

    desc: 'The Russian propaganda is trying hard to extract any positive points from
      Operation Spiderweb, and so it denies, spins and lies like hell. Leaving aside
      the usual "it didn''t happen" and "it happened, but to the Ukrainians" tactics,
      there is one interesting and one comical narrative. The interesting one tries
      to present the Ukrainian attack on Russian strategic bombers, which are part
      of the Russian nuclear triad, as a violation of the international START nuclear
      disarmament convention. Supposedly, according to the treaty, the bombers have
      to be out on the flats, and the rogue Ukraine took advantage of that. The fact
      is that Ukraine is not even among the signatories to the treaty (START I, II
      and III are agreements between the US and Russia only), and Russia unilaterally
      withdrew from New START in 2023. Moreover, the treaty never required the bombers
      to be outside on unprotected surfaces, it only mandated that the nuclear forces
      be inspectable and that their operators make them available for possible inspections.
      The Russians did not keep them in hangars simply because they did not have the
      resources to build expensive hangars for such large machines. The commie then
      tries to portray the loss of the bombers as "proving a service to Russia" because
      supposedly the planes were old and expensive to operate anyway, so Ukraine took
      the ball off Russia''s foot. Comical because the machines may be old, but Russia
      has used them relentlessly to fire missiles at Ukraine, and they are also an
      integral part of Russia''s deterrent, among other reasons, because Russia has
      never produced anything newer and probably can''t produce anything newer. So
      it''s a narrative designed especially for the dumbest of audiences. And then

      \ day's image, without having moved anywhere. So the Russians are probably making\

      to negotiate with. Some are already classic "hits", such as the withdrawal of
      the Ukrainian army from all occupied areas and their cession to Russia, the
      commitment to neutrality, the holding of elections, the non-nuclear status of
      Ukraine, the ban on armaments, etc., but there are also new ones, such as the
      ban on army movements for any purpose other than the withdrawal of troops, amnesty
      for detained collaborators, and the commitment that neither side will demand
      compensation for the damage caused. Ukraine, of course, did not agree to any
      of this, but both delegations agreed to exchange all seriously wounded or seriously
      ill prisoners, and all prisoners under 25 years of age. Zelensky commented on
      the outcome of the negotiations that "probably a few more accidents will have
      to happen in Russia before the Russians start behaving like human beings".

      - Overnight, the Ukrainians launched a large-scale drone strike on targets in
      the occupied territories and especially in Crimea. In Kherson and Zaporizhzhya
      regions, nearly 700 villages, including Henichesk and Melitopol, and potentially
      up to millions of residents, were completely in the dark after electrical substations
      were hit.

      - In his programme, Solovyov called for the shooting of the Russian conscript
      who filmed and published the aftermath of the Russian drone strike on the airport
      near Irkutsk. In the same programme, he also called for Russia to level three
      European countries before they can arm themselves. He was probably referring
      to the Baltic republics.

      - After the initial breakthrough, the Russians managed to advance about 6-7
      kilometers deep into the Sumy area. The Ukrainians are moving one of their elite
      brigades to that front to help stop the Russian offensive. Ukrainian F-16s are
      also taking part in the defence, dropping bombs on the Russians.

      - Zelensky''s adviser Yermak headed to the United States today. Ukraine has
      not yet disclosed what it will discuss in the U.S., but according to Ukrainian
      media, a potential purchase of U.S. weapons is to be the focus of the talks.

      - US House Speaker Johnson surprisingly supported a bill to impose tough sanctions
      on Russia. It was he who blocked arms supplies to Ukraine in the past.

      - Russian channels report that at least 18 Tu-95 and Tu-22 aircraft were irreversibly
      damaged in Operation Pavuchina, and two A-50 early warning aircraft were also
      seriously damaged.

      - Zelensky told Turkish officials that he was ready to meet Putin in person
      because he believed that no ceasefire would happen without a top-level meeting.

      - The SBU carried out an operation in which it mined the pylons of the Crimean
      Bridge below sea level. It is not clear from the videos whether the bridge suffered
      structural damage.

      - The UN General Assembly elected former German Defence Minister Annalena Baerbock
      as its next president.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 60 of 112 Russian kamikaze drones overnight.
      Another 15 drones crashed.

      - The Russians reportedly managed to extend the range of their KAB guided aerial
      bombs to 95 km.

      - A Russian Kijal missile hit Mykolayiv this morning. It is not clear from the
      reports what its target was.

      - The Russians have bombed six fire stations across Ukraine over the past week.

      - Ukraine''s parliament approved a new law establishing the office of military
      ombudsman.

      - The Russians have proposed a three-day ceasefire to allow them to retrieve
      the bodies of fallen soldiers from the battlefield.

      - Russian bombs landed in Chotini near Sumy on the local church, school and
      a neighbouring clinic.

      - Trump congratulated Poland for electing his ally as president.

      - Ukraine received an invitation to the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague.

      - Zelensky signed a law on joint roaming with the EU.

    desc: 'More details are gradually emerging about yesterday''s Operation Spiderweb,
      which led to the destruction of part of the Russian Federation''s strategic
      air force. Multiple bases were targeted, but not all the drone trucks were able
      to carry out their mission. For example, a truck with drones heading - somewhat
      symbolically - to the Ukrainka airbase reportedly burned down en route. The
      drones were guided by Russian mobile networks and artificial intelligence, which
      trained on the outlines of the aircraft over the aviation museum in Poltava.
      The coordinator of the event, the head of civil intelligence, Vasyl Malyuk,
      revealed that due to the nature of the event, all the organisers managed to
      evacuate Russia before it was launched. Thus, if Russia claims to have detained
      anyone, they will only be accidental scapegoats for domestic propaganda. It
      also means that the driver of one of the trucks, who was strangled by onlookers
      in outrage, was probably completely innocent and had no idea about the whole
      event. Malyuk also claims that the total number of machines hit is actually
      41 at 4 different bases, which would be equivalent to 34% of all Russian strategic
      bombers. Satellite images and videos at the moment confirm around 15 aircraft
      destroyed, but do not yet provide a complete picture. The number is almost certain
      to be higher. More in other parts of today''s [review](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02z6AeudET3BwgkBNrmdg97vzhSkJ2b9XKQ3335grwbuevu5TXkeo5vj3gwTcZa1YQl):

    title: Monday
    year: 2 June 2025
    detail: "- MAGA Republicans criticize Ukraine for not informing the United States\
      \ that it is preparing a similar plan. The truth, however, is that perhaps that\
      \ is why the action was successful. The United States has regularly leaked classified\
      \ information to the Russians in the past, including plans for a Ukrainian offensive.\
      \ Ukraine's most successful actions were precisely those that it did not inform\
      \ its partners about. Which means both that Putin currently has no informants\
      \ in the highest levels of Ukraine, but also that at least the US, but also\
      \ other partners, are compromised by Russian agents.\n- Pro-Russian channels\
      \ have described the Pavuchin action as \"Russia's Pearl Harbor\". I would appeal\
      \ to readers to avoid this metaphor, as it feeds the Russian narrative. The\
      \ attack on Pearl Harbor was an unprovoked aggression against a country that\
      \ was not at war with Japan and de facto drew the United States into the war\
      \ in the Pacific. By contrast, Russia has long been at war with Ukraine and\
      \ more than deserves a similar blow.  \n- Russia broke its previous record yesterday.\
      \ During the night from Saturday to Sunday, seven missiles and cruise missiles\
      \ and a whopping 472 kamikaze drones targeted Ukraine. Ukrainian air defense\
      \ forces shot down three missiles and 213 drones. Another 172 drones crashed.\
      \ Then tonight, 80 drones and 4 missiles flew into Ukraine. 15 drones were destroyed\
      \ by kinetic force and another 37 drones crashed.\n- The commander of Ukraine's\
      \ ground forces, Mykhailo Vasylovych Drapatyi, has offered Zelensky his resignation\
      \ over the recent Russian airstrike on a training ground that killed 12 soldiers.\
      \ Zelensky has not yet revealed whether he will accept the resignation. He plans\
      \ to meet Drapaty in person first.\n- Ukrainian drones attacked Russian air\
      \ bases again today. Russian channels are reporting an airstrike on the Borisoglebsk\
      \ base. According to the Russians, no equipment was damaged but personnel were\
      \ killed. Satellite also indicates that something is burning at Tikhoretsk airport\
      \ near Krasnodar.\n- A few days ago, Russian propaganda circulated an artificial\
      \ intelligence-generated image purporting to show dozens of destroyed F-16 fighter\
      \ jets at one of Ukraine's military airports. The image was also spread uncritically\
      \ by the Czech pro-Russian fifth column.\n- Starmer reported that Britain had\
      \ entered a state of war alert and was prepared to respond to any threats with\
      \ force. The British also plan to build 12 new nuclear submarines and invest\
      \ £15 billion in new nuclear warheads.\n- Because of the fact that Ukrainian\
      \ intelligence has published details of how it carried out its attack on Russian\
      \ airports, traffic jams are now forming in Russia as police and the army stop\
      \ and control all freight traffic in panic.\n- Zelensky warned Europeans of\
      \ Russia's unspecified plan. He literally said: \"Just ask your intelligence\
      \ agencies what Russia is preparing for action from the territory of Belarus\
      \ during this summer. Europe must prepare immediately!\"\n- Another round of\
      \ peace dialogues has begun in Turkey. The Ukrainians gave the Russian delegation\
      \ their version of the memorandum in Ukrainian and English. The Russians commented\
      \ that fortunately they had persons with them who speak foreign languages.\n\
      - Daniel \"Vidlak\" Sterzik, leader of the Enough coalition, wrote on Facebook:\
      \ \"So when the Russians come, only those who won't cooperate with them have\
      \ to be afraid. I am friends with the Russians, so I don't have to be afraid.\"\
      \n- Ukrainian intelligence has warned Europe that the Russian FSB is recruiting\
      \ pro-Russian Ukrainians across Europe for sabotage and other attacks.\n- Latvia\
      \ will restrict entry to Russians who own property near strategic infrastructure.\n\
      - The Pigment paint and varnish factory in St. Petersburg is on fire. Locals\
      \ say the fire was preceded by explosions.\n- The Polish presidential election\
      \ is narrowly won by Eurosceptic Nawrocki with 50.89% of the vote.\n- At the\
      \ front, New Zealand Legionnaire Shan-Le Kearns was killed by a Russian drone.\n"

    desc: 'Today''s news of the day is definitely the Ukrainian strike on two Russian
      strategic bomber bases: the Olenya near Murmansk and the Belaya near Irkutsk.
      Both were hit by dozens of drones, which, according to witnesses, flew out of
      trucks from the site, and it seems that their drivers often had no idea what
      they were carrying. In fact, at least one driver was detained by the police
      when he ran in a panic around a truck near Olenogorsk from which the drones
      had previously taken off, and was supposed to have told the police that he had
      no idea what he was carrying and that he had only been tasked to drive to a
      certain place where he was supposed to hand over the truck. The driver of another
      truck was strangled by people who tried to intervene. In addition, the trailers
      self-destructed after the drones were launched. According to preliminary information,
      dozens of aircraft were destroyed or heavily damaged in the attack, including
      Tu-22M3, Tu-160, Tu-95MS strategic bombers, Il-78M, An-26, An-12, MiG-31 and
      Beriev A-50 early warning aircraft. Other information suggests that the Russian
      air bases of Diaghilevo near Ryazani, Voskresensk near Moscow and Engels-2 near
      Saratov were also under attack. More details are awaited here, but attacks on
      at least four or five bases have been confirmed by the Russian Fighterbomber
      channel. Ukraine is said to have been preparing the action, codenamed "Pavuchina",
      for 18 months. The attack used relatively cheap FPV drones carrying powerful
      explosives. It is also possible that more trucks are still on the way. Putin
      has called an emergency meeting over the attacks, and Russian channels speculate
      that he may want to use the Oreshnik system to demonstrate a strike on Ukraine.

    detail: '- In the last 24 hours, the guerrillas have carried out at least three
      sabotages of the Russian railway and road infrastructure, which serves the Russian
      army for the movement of ammunition and equipment to the front, especially in
      the Bryansk and Kursk regions. The incidents unfortunately resulted in civilian
      casualties. Near Bryansk, a bridge collapsed when a passenger train was crossing
      it. At least 7 people died and 69 were injured. Near Kursk, a road bridge collapsed
      onto a passing train. The number of casualties is unknown. In the last incident
      so far, the Unecha-Zhecha line was damaged. The Russians claim that explosives
      were used in all cases.

      - The Ukrainian delegation is preparing for the next round of talks in Istanbul.
      But Zelensky said the Russians have not told anyone what demands or proposals
      they are bringing to the meeting, not even the Turkish or U.S. mediators.

      - Russian troops have advanced in the border region of Sumy and entered at least
      four other villages. The Russians are also trying to establish a new line of
      attack south of the town of Guevo.

      - Ukrainian military intelligence reports that it has successfully sabotaged
      a Russian freight train heading to Crimea via the occupied part of Zaporizhzhya
      region.

      - A powerful explosion rocked the port of Severomorsk in Murmansk, home base
      of Russian nuclear submarines from the Northern Fleet.

      - According to new information, Qatar did not offer Trump the luxury plane,
      worth around $400 million, but Trump himself asked for it.

      - Former US Secretary of State Pompeo warned Trump to stop legitimising Russia''s
      annexation of Ukrainian territory.

      - The OPEC+ group will increase oil production for the third time in three months
      in June, this time by 411,000 barrels per day.

      - The Russians hit a Ukrainian training ground with missiles in the morning,
      killing 12 soldiers and wounding 60 others.

      - Ukrainian drones hit the Splav plant near Tula, which produces salvo rocket
      launchers for the Russian army.

    detail: "- Russia claims that Serbian companies are supplying arms and ammunition\
      \ to Ukraine. The Serbian President has therefore proposed a joint Serbian-Russian\
      \ investigation to confirm or deny the information, and possibly to find out\
      \ how Serbian weapons end up in Ukraine. However, just one day after Russia\
      \ made the accusation, an explosion rocked one of Serbia's munitions factories\
      \ - the Krusik munitions plant.\n- Trump is fond of boasting that he was the\
      \ one who supplied Ukraine with Javelin missiles before the invasion, which\
      \ helped stop the initial Russian offensive. But his former special envoy, Kurt\
      \ Volker, who arranged the whole thing, now claims that Trump didn't care about\
      \ Ukraine at the time and that his only concern was whether Ukraine would pay\
      \ for the missiles.\n- Keith Kellogg said that the United States is prepared\
      \ to stop admitting more members to NATO to calm Russian fears, while at the\
      \ same time, he said, Ukraine's membership in NATO is completely out of the\
      \ question at the moment. Lipavsky responded by saying that NATO expansion is\
      \ not a threat to anyone, but rather a guarantee of peace.\n- An unusually large\
      \ number of Il-76 military cargo planes have turned around at Russia's Engels-2\
      \ airport in recent days. A massive raid on Ukraine is therefore expected in\
      \ the coming days.\n- China has restricted the export of Mavic drones to Ukraine\
      \ due to the fact that they are used for military purposes. However, drones\
      \ from the same manufacturer continue to be available on the Russian market\
      \ without restrictions.\n- During an overnight raid, the Russians hit a trolleybus\
      \ depot in Kharkiv and destroyed 19 trolleybuses. Another branch of Nova Posta\
      \ in Odessa was also hit.\n- The Georgian pro-Russian government again cracked\
      \ down on opposition leaders, detaining one of them, the leader of the opposition\
      \ party \"Coalition for Change\".\n- According to analysts, North Korea may\
      \ have transferred up to 9 million pieces of various munitions and at least\
      \ 100 ballistic missiles to Russia in the last 18 months.\n- Russia's envoy\
      \ to the UN has said that for a ceasefire to take place, the West must stop\
      \ supplying arms to Ukraine and Ukraine must stop mobilising.\n- Ukraine has\
      \ called a meeting of the UN Security Council for this evening over the continuing\
      \ Russian attacks on Ukraine's civilian population.\n- Orbán said that Ukraine\
      \ is a dangerous country, and therefore \"Ukrainians should stay out of the\
      \ EU, not inside it.\"\n- Peskov announced that a Russian delegation would fly\
      \ to Istanbul on June 2 to await Ukrainian negotiators.\n- Ukrainian air defense\
      \ forces shot down 26 of 90 Russian kamikaze drones overnight. Another 30 drones\
      \ crashed.\n- Ukrainian military intelligence sabotaged a Russian naval base\
      \ as far away as Vladivostok.\n- The SBU arrested four collaborators in Kherson\
      \ who were helping the Russians organize fake referendums.\n- Zelensky criticized\
      \ Russia for not yet presenting its draft peace memorandum.\n- The Polish president\
      \ awarded the Order of Merit to the head of Ukrainian civilian intelligence,\
      \ Budanov.\n- According to Syrian, Ukrainian drones hit some 89,000 Russian\
      \ targets in May alone.\n- The Russians rallied around 60,000 troops for the\
      \ Kostyantynivka raid.\n- Czech MPs approved a ban on the promotion of the communist\
      \ movement.  \n"

      Political Action Conference) - populists from all over Europe met. Orbán, Abascal,
      Kickl, but also Babiš, Morawiecki and Trump''s Secretary of Homeland Security
      Kristi Noem, who at a similar meeting in Poland a few days ago lobbied for presidential
      candidate Nawrocki so indiscriminately that she angered a large number of Poles,
      were here.

      - For the time being, German Chancellor Merz will not provide Ukraine with Taurus
      missiles, but will fund the production of medium-range missiles and rockets
      directly in Ukraine, with no restrictions on what they can and cannot hit, which
      could be the "analogue" to Taurus missiles. Merz also committed to Germany paying
      for Ukraine''s Starlink terminals and providing Ukraine with additional air
      defense systems.

      - Journalists from Der Spiegel and the Danwatch project gained access to two
      million Russian secret documents that reveal, among other things, the full locations
      of Russian nuclear bases, including complete plans of the facilities down to
      the last toilet, as well as their IT systems, security and other infrastructure
      elements. This is reportedly the largest ever leak of documents from the Russian
      military.

      - The Finnish President has told all those who fear a possible Russian attack
      on Finland that "Finland can do it alone". According to him, Finland has 900
      000 people who have undergone compulsory military service, 124 modern fighter
      jets and one of the largest artilleries among NATO armies, so there is no need
      to worry about Finland.

      - The Stavropol bombing killed Russian Major Zaur Gurtsiev, who was nicknamed
      ''the butcher'' by the Ukrainians because he commanded the air force responsible
      for the air strikes on Mariupol. The attacker himself, Nikita Penkov, who had
      an explosive device in his bag, was also killed in the assassination.

      - U.S. Secretary of State Rubio announced that the U.S. would impose sanctions
      on European statesmen who suppress the free speech of American citizens abroad.
      All this at a time when the Trump administration is having foreign citizens
      deported based on their social media posts.

      - The French magazine Charlie Hebdo has spoken out strongly against the fake
      anti-Ukrainian-themed covers, which replicate the magazine''s visual identity
      and are probably created and distributed by Russian propaganda channels and
      troll farms.

      - Telegram owner Pavel Durov says he has reached an agreement with Musk to extend
      the Grok AI assistant from Twitter/X to Telegram. But Musk clarified that nothing
      has been signed yet.

      - Mazda has denied that its cars are returning to the Russian market. Meanwhile,
      it advertises new cars on its own website at dealerships across Russia.

      - Overnight, a severe fire broke out at the Avangard plant in St. Petersburg,
      where microelectronics are made. It took firefighters six hours to extinguish
      the blaze.

      - Britain is considering permanently deploying troops in the Arctic because
      of Russia''s multiplying actions in the region.

      - According to Ukrainian authorities, 1,279 of the approximately 2,500 imprisoned
      Azov members have returned from Russian captivity since the war began.

      - According to Reuters, NATO will call on Germany to create seven new brigades
      totalling 40,000 troops.

      - Russians hit a farm near Mykolaiv with a missile. Three of its employees were
      wounded and one other succumbed to his injuries.

      - Ukrainian air defence forces shot down 10 of 90 Russian kamikaze drones overnight.
      Another 46 drones crashed.

      - Trump said that "in two weeks it will be clear whether Russia is holding up
      peace talks."

      - According to Lavrov, Germany is openly involved in the ongoing war in Ukraine.

      - The Russians are reportedly planning to deploy Oreshnik systems in Belarus
      by the end of the year.

      - Turkey and Belgium will join the so-called "Drone Coalition" for Ukraine.

      - Elon Musk has resigned from all positions in the Trump administration.

      of really bad things would have happened to Russia already, and I mean REALLY
      BAD. He''s playing with fire!" What was probably meant to sound like a strong-arm
      threat really just comes across as an admission that Trump has been covering
      for Putin all along, preventing moves that would put his position in jeopardy.
      Just how "strongman" such messages are for Russians themselves, after all, was
      best shown by a tweet from Russian state broadcaster RT, which quoted his threats

    detail: "- Russia had a very rough night and morning. Around three hundred Ukrainian\
      \ drones attacked targets there. We know from preliminary information that the\
      \ Kronstadt factory in the town of Dubna, near Moscow, which produces various\
      \ types of drones, and the nearby N.P. Fedorov machine plant, which produces\
      \ components for aircraft and cruise missiles, were among those hit. The site\
      \ of the Elma technopark plant in Zelenograd, which develops and manufactures\
      \ various microelectronics, was also affected. Another facility affected was\
      \ the Russian company Raduga, which produces all 'Ch' series missiles in addition\
      \ to aircraft.\n- Ukraine did not hand over any North Korean soldiers to the\
      \ Russians in the 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange. They fear that if they\
      \ return home, Kim Jong-un will have them and their families executed for having\
      \ allowed themselves to be captured. The Russians, on the other hand, deceived\
      \ Ukraine and handed over to it as 'prisoners' all sorts of prisoners - Ukrainian\
      \ citizens - whom they were planning to deport anyway. Many of them had already\
      \ been sentenced to prison terms before 2022 and had never taken part in the\
      \ fighting.\n- Sources in Russia suggest that the number of fallen Russian soldiers\
      \ exceeded 300 000. In fact, the Russian Ministry of Labour has already had\
      \ more than 300,000 certificates issued to the surviving families of men killed\
      \ in military service. This figure probably does not include the tens of thousands\
      \ of other people that Russia is registering as \"lost\" so that it does not\
      \ have to pay compensation to their families.  \n- Lavrov said that one of Russia's\
      \ key demands in any peace talks is that Ukraine be a neutral country without\
      \ nuclear weapons. Yet Ukraine was already a neutral country without nuclear\
      \ weapons when Russia repeatedly attacked it. NATO did not want it then, as\
      \ it has repeatedly made clear, precisely to allay Russian fears. Yet Russia\
      \ attacked.\n- Putin claims that Russia's economy is now 4th in the world in\
      \ real gross domestic product. For context, this ranking is dominated by China\
      \ ahead of the United States in second and India in third. Realistically, however,\
      \ this says nothing about the true state of the Russian economy, because Russia's\
      \ GDP is driven up by massive production of weapons and military equipment,\
      \ which are high value-added goods.\n- Putin is reportedly demanding that NATO\
      \ refuse to admit not only Ukraine but also Georgia, Moldova and other former\
      \ Soviet republics to the alliance. There is probably no need to explain why.\n\
      - Sweden and Denmark have sent Ukraine old fishing nets worth millions of euros.\
      \ Ukraine is using them as a means of protection against Russian drones.\n-\
      \ Romanian prosecutors have launched a criminal prosecution against the ousted\
      \ pro-Russian presidential candidate Georgescu for promoting Romania's former\
      \ fascist legions.\n- Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 34 of 88 Russian\
      \ kamikaze drones overnight. Another 37 drones crashed. Russia also fired six\
      \ missiles and cruise missiles.\n- Belarus announced that it would move planned\
      \ military manoeuvres \"West\" further inland from the Polish border to \"ease\
      \ tensions\".\n- According to Zelensky, Russia still mobilises between 40-50,000\
      \ people each month, while Ukraine mobilises between 25-27,000.\n- According\
      \ to Bild newspaper, Russia still earns more on trade with Europe than Europe\
      \ gives Ukraine for its defence.\n- Dutch authorities have accused a Russian\
      \ hacking group linked to the Russian government of cyber attacks on NATO structures.\n\
      - Russia is building high-voltage pylons at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant\
      \ to connect it to the Russian grid.\n- According to the latest poll, 82% of\
      \ all Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine perceive Russia negatively.\n- The\
      \ 304th ammunition depot of the Russian 35th Army is burning in the remote Amur\
      \ region.\n- Zelensky has arrived in Germany for talks with Chancellor Merz.\n\
      - Germany has secretly handed over more Gepard systems to Ukraine.\n"

      \ kamikaze drones. Explosions have been heard in thirteen Ukrainian regions.\
      \ Ukrainian air defense forces shot down all the missiles and also 288 drones.\
      \ But according to foreign analysts, Ukraine is running out of missiles for\
      \ some of its air defence systems, not only for Patriots but also, for example,\
      \ the Italian SAMP/T and French Crotale.\n- Trump said that \"something has\
      \ happened to Putin\" because despite the fact that they have a \"very good\
      \ relationship\", Putin has \"gone completely crazy\" and is firing missiles\
      \ and sending drones to Ukraine \"for absolutely no reason\". But at the same\
      \ time, Trump criticized Zelensky. He says he is doing his country a disservice\
      \ by the way he talks and \"everything that comes out of his mouth just causes\
      \ more problems.\"\n- Two years ago at this time, Russia captured Bakhmut, after\
      \ virtually destroying Wagner's group as a viable military force. Since then\
      \ it has only moved 12 km west to the next town, which is Chasiv Yar, and which\
      \ it has not conquered to this day.  \n- Canadian Prime Minister Carney has\
      \ said that the major American communications platforms have become \"a sea\
      \ of racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and hate in all its forms\"\
      \ and has indicated that his government will take strong steps to regulate them.\
      \  \n- According to the head of Ukraine's foreign intelligence service, Russia's\
      \ mobilization potential is equal to roughly 25 million people, 3 million of\
      \ whom have received basic training in the past. However, Russia is said to\
      \ be struggling with problems in arms production.\n- According to Ukrainian\
      \ engineers, the current models of Russian Geran/Shahed kamikaze drones are\
      \ guided by AI, Ukrainian mobile networks and stored maps, and are thus completely\
      \ immune to jamming of their GPS signals.\n- According to Ukrainian intelligence,\
      \ the Russians have deployed strategic bombers and Iskander systems capable\
      \ of launching nuclear missiles in Belarus, but no nuclear warheads have yet\
      \ crossed the Belarusian border.  \n- The Financial Times reports that China\
      \ may be preparing a strike on Taiwan. All branches of the Chinese People's\
      \ Army are now in position and on maximum alert.\n- According to German Chancellor\
      \ Merz, the UK, France, Germany and the US have lifted restrictions on strikes\
      \ deep into Russian territory using Western systems.\n- Ukrainian drones have\

      state in many places and build tourist attractions around them, as Russia did
      in the past in the destroyed city of Stalingrad, so that Russians can go with
      their children to see the results of their "patriotic resistance against the
      West". At this point it is worth reiterating that Russian propaganda for foreign
      audiences is diametrically opposed to the messages that reach Russian audiences.
      This is most evident in the current peace negotiations. While externally, Putin,
      through his fifth column and propaganda channels, sends out messages about how
      Russia is oppressed by the West and wishes for nothing but world peace, Russian
      domestic propaganda daily calls for the complete destruction of the Ukrainian

    detail: '- Anton Kobiakov, an adviser to the Russian dictator, told the conference
      that "the process by which the Soviet Union was dismantled in 1991 has been
      disrupted and therefore the Soviet Union still exists de jure". He then turned
      to the conflict in Ukraine and told the audience that "because the USSR still
      exists, the conflict in Ukraine is not an aggression, but an internal conflict".

      - The Russian Foreign Ministry announced that Ukrainians must first elect a
      new representation so that Russia can sign a memorandum on the road to peace.
      Lavrov also told the Russian audience that "there will be no more ceasefires,
      because Russia has already agreed to them in the past, and will not do so any
      more."

      - In the Baltic Sea, Poland sent its ship to meet a tanker from Russia''s shadow
      fleet that was making suspicious maneuvers in the area where the undersea infrastructure
      linking Sweden to Poland runs. After the tanker spotted the Polish ship, it
      swiftly sailed to the Russian port of Kaliningrad.

      - In a new report, CNN has published wiretaps of Russian communications showing
      that the Russian command ordered the attacking troops to "capture the Ukrainian
      commanders and shoot the rest of the soldiers." And as we know from the reconnaissance
      drone videos, that is exactly what the Russians then did all along the front.

      - Russian channels reported that Ukrainian sabotage troops were spotted near
      the village of Vygonichi in the Bryansk region. In order to understand the significance
      of this report, it is necessary to know that the village of Vygonichi is 80
      km from the Ukrainian border and 30 km from Bryansk itself.

      - The Washington Post claims that Trump told Western leaders after his phone
      call with Putin that Putin has no plans to end the war. Other sources also claim
      that Trump was convinced after the phone call that Russia was now winning.

      - Kadyrov''s son hadn''t received any medals for a long time, so there was a
      need to make amends. He has now received a medal for "developing the National
      Guard" and allegedly "participating in a Special Military Operation."

      - The United States conducted two successful tests of its Minuteman III intercontinental
      missiles. Both missiles flew more than 6,000 km and hit their target in the
      Marshall Islands.

      - Lindsey Graham has called on Putin to immediately introduce steps towards
      peace with Ukraine or he will impose tariffs of 500% on all countries trading
      with Russia.

      - Dozens of Ukrainian drones attacked targets in Russia overnight. Russia again
      had to close all major airports within drone range.

      - President Trump accepted the largest bribe in US history: a luxury plane from
      Qatar worth around $400 million.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 74 of 128 Russian kamikaze drones last
      night. Another 38 drones crashed.

      - Four Chechen officers were killed in a bomb attack in the occupied Kherson
      region.

      - According to the German defence minister, Trump overestimated his influence
      and negotiating skills.

    desc: 'The Orbán government has inadvertently exposed how its propaganda network
      works, flooding social networks with pro-government and pro-Russian content.
      Opposition leader and current mayor of Budapest Gergely Karácsony is currently
      under fire from accounts accusing him of being a traitor for repeatedly meeting
      with a man accused by the Orbán authorities of spying for Ukraine. But the robotic
      accounts accidentally share the comment even with the obvious instructions,
      and so the discussions on Karácsony''s profiles are filled with comments like
      "hazaáruló (egy szó)", which literally means "treason (one word)". Every country
      in the world has similar stories. Yet governments are completely incapable of
      cracking down on robotic "troll" farms, allowing them to influence social discourse
      and win elections in favour of hostile states. And this is exactly what another
      [news item](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid029rdk2KhzVZ76umbmwr6mpuBMH7n6ZkXMNdnQrFc8rXkaPH4ex6cjQvUhLj1kegSbl)
      is about:

      '
    detail: '- Pro-Russian presidential candidate Simion announced that he will challenge
      the Romanian election result in the Constitutional Court for alleged foreign
      interference. He found a surprising ally in Telegram owner Durov, who promised
      to come and testify in his favour. Somewhat paradoxically, the elections were
      indeed accompanied by massive foreign interference, but by Russia and in support
      of Simion. Meanwhile, two countries in particular have not congratulated the
      newly elected President Dan: Russia and the United States. Not even the US embassy
      in Bucharest sent Dan congratulations.

      - An unknown assailant shot dead in broad daylight in a street near Madrid a
      former adviser to Ukrainian President Yanukovych, Andriy Portnov, who fled to
      Russia with Yanukovych immediately after the Maidan. Four projectiles hit Portnov
      in the chest while he was driving his car, and after he staggered out onto the
      pavement, his attacker finished him off with one shot to the back of the head.

      - A Russian missile struck a Ukrainian base and training ground near Sum. Six
      soldiers were killed and 10 others wounded in the attack, according to Ukrainian
      sources. The National Guard is now investigating who is responsible for the
      tragedy. In any case, the Russians claim that the death toll is 70 and that
      an ammunition depot and at least 10 pieces of equipment were destroyed. But
      even their own videos do not confirm this.

      - The Ukrainian military warns that Russia is massing a significant number of
      troops near the border with the Kharkiv region and will probably try to open
      a new front in the direction of Kharkiv and Sumy. It should be added that Russia
      probably planned this attack last year, but was prevented from doing so by the
      Ukrainian attack on Kursk.

      - In Berlin, the trial has begun of three Russian citizens who, according to
      the indictment, in cooperation with Russian intelligence, gathered information
      on critical infrastructure and planned sabotage and attacks on railways in the
      country, even against military installations, including the US Grafenwöhr base.

      - Poland''s opposition presidential candidate Nawrocki turned around and announced
      that he would not support Ukraine''s entry into NATO, presumably to win the
      votes of extremist party voters.

      - According to US newspapers, Trump refuses to label Russia as an aggressor
      and to impose further sanctions against it because he does not want to lose
      investment opportunities in Moscow.

      - Poland will try a man who investigators say was recruited by Russian intelligence
      to help carry out the assassination of President Zelensky.

      - France has sent its survey ship Dupuy de Lôme to the Baltic Sea to help monitor
      the movements of tankers from Russia''s shadow fleet.

      - Russia had to cancel its planned demonstration launch of the Jars intercontinental
      ballistic missile, probably due to technical problems.

      - The Czech Foreign Ministry was contacted by a Czech who went to Russia and
      joined its army. The Ministry is asking for help with repatriation.

      - Ukrainian drones hit a Russian semiconductor plant in the Orel region. At
      least ten drones struck the facility.

      - Unknown attackers opened fire on several Russian military posts around the
      Hmeimim airbase in Syria.

      - The Ukrainian Air Defense Forces shot down 22 of a total of 76 Russian kamikaze
      drones overnight. Another 41 drones crashed.

      - A NATO troop exercise called Spring Storm began in Estonia. Some 16,000 troops
      are taking part.

      - The Vatican has confirmed that it is ready to host peace talks between Russia
      and Ukraine.

      - According to Russian journalists, around 50,000 Russian soldiers are wanted
      for desertion.

      - Radio Free Europe receives €6.2 million from the EU for its operation.

      - The Russians release the detained tanker Green Admire.

      - The EU prepares a "drastic" 18th package of sanctions against Russia.

    desc: 'Trump had a roughly two-hour long phone call with dictator Putin yesterday.
      According to Trump, the tone of the entire conversation was "excellent" and
      Trump was to offer Putin a complete reintegration of the Russian economy into
      world trade in exchange for stopping the war. According to Trump, the two warring
      parties will also immediately begin negotiations for a ceasefire and peace.
      Putin also said the call was very productive. Putin announced that he has agreed
      to work together on a memorandum outlining future agreements where both sides
      will have to make compromises on the road to peace. But he rejected the ceasefire
      offered by Ukraine. Ukraine later responded that it had no information about
      any forthcoming memorandum and had no idea what Putin was talking about. According
      to Zelensky, Putin is manipulating Trump to buy time. And he''s probably not
      wrong. Anyway, there are other [reports](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0i7J47ope8JUE7NwyTnZmWyRWzfG3hpYrpZzLA2krDAZFzqp7o1XjxeKWnNCnWrK4l):

      '
    detail: '- Trump and Musk hardly appear together anymore, Musk has also significantly
      reduced his public appearances and writing on networks. According to Republican
      Party insiders, Musk is a write-off because his popularity has plummeted so
      steeply that most Americans hate him. Musk''s ''DOGE'' has also failed, managing
      to cause total chaos in some federal agencies, the disintegration of institutions
      and the weakening of the United States at home and in the world, all in exchange
      for only minor savings in the US budget.

      - Russia is significantly increasing its presence close to the Finnish border.
      Satellite imagery has revealed new bases for thousands of troops, airfields
      with hangars for fighter planes, helipads, as well as defensive features such
      as trench systems, anti-tank ditches and other barriers.

      - Putin reportedly repeated his demand for the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces
      from the occupied areas during his phone call with Trump. Zelensky categorically
      denied that Ukraine should withdraw from its own territories. According to Zelensky,
      the demands show that Russia is not interested in peace.

      - Romania''s outgoing president signed a pair of laws that will allow the Ukrainian
      military to shoot down Russian drones that violate or threaten Romanian airspace.

      - Spain was hit today by a massive outage of mobile and data networks of virtually
      all operators. This is the second total failure of parts of the civilian infrastructure
      in less than a month.

      - Polish customs officials seized a cargo of 5 metric tonnes of tyres for Boeing
      civil aircraft that the perpetrators tried to smuggle into Russia via Belarus
      despite sanctions.

      - The Ukrainian SBU detained a 17-year-old boy who, following instructions from
      Russian intelligence, was planning to carry out a bomb attack on a military
      commissariat in Kiev.

      - According to the Bild newspaper, Western intelligence agencies believe that
      if Russia succeeds in Ukraine, it will invade Poland or the Baltics with up
      to 1 million troops.

      - The European Union wants to approach the G7 to agree to lower the price ceiling
      on Russian oil from the current $60 a barrel to $50.

      - Lithuania is suing Belarus in the International Court of Justice. The Lithuanians
      say Belarus is smuggling migrants from Africa and the Middle East into Europe.

      - Less than two-thirds of Americans, according to the poll, don''t trust Putin''s
      desire for peace and approve of possible further sanctions against Russia.

      - Hungary''s parliament passed a law calling for an end to Hungary''s participation
      in the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 35 of 108 Russian kamikaze drones overnight.
      Another 58 drones crashed.

      - The United States completed development of the new B61-13 nuclear bomb a year
      ahead of schedule.

      - The Russians hit waterworks in the Sumy region. Fortunately, there was no
      flooding of villages.

    desc: 'Russia has lost another European election. Thanks to a record turnout in
      the second round of the presidential elections in Romania, the pro-European
      candidate Dan won, not the pro-Russian ultra-nationalist Simion. However, during
      the vote count, Simion attempted to declare himself the winner on social media,
      inadvertently adding the flag of Chad instead of the flag of Romania. It is
      also good news that in a part of Romania where there is a very large Hungarian
      minority, not a majority, the pro-European candidate won around 90% of the vote.
      In any case, the elections were once again accompanied by disinformation massively
      disseminated from fake pro-Russian accounts and troll farms. And it is no different
      in other countries. But besides that, [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid027A8obRtkTe9mpuw2nyq6xeHZbxakgGoPYd9z85KPZyou55EjzqFqfdiZFfmRxatql)
      also happened:

      '
    detail: '- The Times claims in an article that engineers have discovered radio
      communication elements hidden in Chinese components at several U.S. solar farms,
      as well as "kill switches," or switches - either physical or software - that
      could potentially allow the Chinese to shut down their components remotely,
      and with it, shut down entire power plants. Meanwhile, the same Chinese-made
      components are said to be used in solar and wind power plants around the world.

      - Belgium has revealed the contents of a forthcoming military aid package to
      Ukraine worth around a billion euros. It will include 20 upgraded Cerber air
      defence systems, Leopard tanks with upgraded turrets, 16,000 small arms, 100
      armoured ambulances and transport vehicles, 5 maritime drones, FPV drones, military
      equipment, medical supplies, as well as drone detection systems.

      - Thousands of people in Hungary are protesting against a draft law from the
      pen of Orbán''s party that would allow the persecution of entities raising money
      from abroad. A law that is clearly inspired by a similar Russian and, more recently,
      Georgian law.

      - China is following the new trends in modern warfare very closely. Next month,
      it plans to unveil a new "mothership", or SS-UAV, that can carry and control
      up to 100 FPV drones on board simultaneously.

      - Russia is circulating a fake video claiming that a Ukrainian interpreter who
      accompanied a government delegation to Turkey fled after the meeting to avoid
      mobilization. Of course, this is not true.

      - The liberal candidate Trzaskowski won the first round of the Polish presidential
      elections with 31.4% of the vote. In the second round, he will face the Eurosceptic
      from the PiS party, Nawrocki.

      - According to an article by Bloomberg, Putin believes that the Russian army
      will succeed in occupying the rest of the occupied areas of Ukraine by the end
      of the year and is therefore not interested in a ceasefire.

      - France has denied that its government or intelligence services have ever asked
      the Telegram network to suppress "conservative voices," as its CEO Pavel Durov
      has claimed.

      - Russia has branded Amnesty International an undesirable organisation, despite
      its seemingly neutral sycophantic statements on the war in Ukraine.

      - Zelensky presented the new Pope with an icon of Mary and the Child Jesus painted
      on a piece of an artillery ammunition crate brought from Izjum.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 41 of 112 Russian kamikaze drones overnight.
      Another 35 drones crashed.

      - In a televised debate, Yana Malachova said she was not following the situation
      in Russia, nor was she interested in it.

      - Finland will buy artillery ammunition for Ukraine with proceeds from seized
      Russian assets.

      - Australia has set in motion the delivery of 49 Abrams tanks to Ukraine.

      Russian designer and one of the authors of the Iskander missile system, Vladimir
      Nedoshivin. Or rather, the story of the very end of his life. Vladimir celebrated
      his 73rd and final birthday this year. On Victory Day, 9 May, he celebrated
      "victory over Nazism" with particular intensity. So much so that when he finally
      hit home, he had to defecate outside his apartment. Unfortunately for him, he
      was caught by a neighbour urinating on the staircase in the common areas of
      the house. In his anger, the neighbour pushed the drunken Vladimir down the
      stairs. Vladimir did not survive the fall. I just hope the neighbor gets a gift
      basket from Ukrainian intelligence in the near future. Since he''s doing their
      job for them. And there''s [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid034HhPrsVrWduUUFe86joGugcqDCMNmnMBvk2UpJvtwnUKATAfyBEBfM2QkmsVa6ytl):

      \ to him to \"suppress conservative voices ahead of the ongoing presidential\
      \ elections in Romania\", which he allegedly did not comply with in the name\
      \ of freedom of speech. Let me translate this from propaganda into English:\
      \ Durov refused to crack down on the giant Russian robotic content farms that\
      \ were providing a massive and unchecked outlet for a pro-Russian far-right\
      \ candidate.\n- Analyst Christo Grozev revealed how U.S. negotiator Witkoff\
      \ unwittingly used Russian agent Natalia Koshkina as an interpreter during a\
      \ meeting with Putin in Moscow, believing she was an interpreter from the U.S.\
      \ embassy. Yet regulations require that U.S. delegates always have their own\
      \ interpreters at foreign meetings.\n- Russia last night launched its largest\
      \ ever drone strike on Ukrainian cities. At one point, 273 kamikaze drones were\
      \ in the air. 88 were shot down by Ukrainian air defense forces, and another\
      \ 128 crashed. Several people were killed in the raid.\n- Finnish President\
      \ Stubb reminded Trump that Russia has long been a non-power. Russia's economy\
      \ is smaller than Italy's, and the Russian army has occupied less than 1% of\
      \ Ukraine's landmass this year despite huge losses.  \n- Putin has signed a\
      \ decree allowing residents of two occupied regions of Georgia, South Ossetia\
      \ and Abkhazia, to obtain Russian citizenship in an accelerated procedure.\n\
      - Hungary appealed to the NATO Secretary-General to take action against the\
      \ alleged disinformation campaign organised by Ukraine.\n- A Russian court sent\
      \ a captured Australian volunteer behind bars for 13 years for \"international\
      \ terrorism\" in a staged trial.\n- According to former CIA director Petraeus,\
      \ a ceasefire with Russia is unrealistic this year, not because of Zelensky,\
      \ but because of Putin.\n- Russia detained the Greek oil tanker Green Admire\
      \ in the Baltic Sea shortly after it left the Estonian port.\n- Zelensky was\
      \ in Rome for a meeting with US Vice President Vance and Secretary of State\
      \ Rubio.\n- At an economic forum in Kazan, Taliban representatives called on\
      \ Russia to fund the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\n- Ukrainian intelligence\
      \ says Russia is planning a live test of its Jars intercontinental missile tonight.\n\
      - The Ukrainians have eliminated elite Russian sniper and Syria veteran Vitaly\

      on a road near Sumy, in which a group of people were travelling to escape the
      Russian army from border villages. At least 9 people died on the spot. Most

      man, a woman and their daughter. Other people were wounded. Given that this

    desc: 'First, a trilateral meeting between the United States, Turkey and Ukraine
      took place in Turkey today. It was followed later by talks between Russia, Turkey
      and Ukraine. Zelensky is not participating in the delegation talks. He will,
      in his own words, negotiate only with Putin. The Russians, having classically
      arrived late, reportedly asked at the last minute that the Turkish delegation
      leave the meeting after the opening remarks. The Ukrainians, however, were not
      to be cornered, refusing to debate in Russian, so the Russian delegation had
      to bring in a translator. The meeting ended prematurely anyway after the Russians
      again voiced their demand for the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Ukrainian
      territory and other unrealistic demands. According to the Ukrainian delegation,
      the Russian demands were outrageous and even beyond what Russia had previously
      demanded. It is therefore obvious that Russia does not want peace. It only wants
      the complete surrender and disarmament of Ukraine. Anyway, this is also what
      has been happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0JZqaJSXsgZbzAnzEbS5dJNjKVhGZzdKgLvGeqwbWP4x6apWrPGvx4pxnVetsH47El):

      \ information about people and property associated with the British Prime Minister\
      \ that he could never have accessed as a mere plant, it is almost certain that\
      \ he was working with someone's intelligence.\n- The Ukrainian Air Force announced\
      \ that it lost another F-16 in today's Russian airstrike when it engaged Russian\
      \ cruise missiles. Three missiles were destroyed by the pilot and a technical\
      \ fault developed while working on the fourth. The pilot guided the fighter\
      \ out of the formation, where it ejected and survived the incident without injury.\n\

      \ are even talking about the start of the long-announced Russian summer offensive.\
      \ The Russians are also trying to open new sections of the front near Sumy and\
      \ Chernihiv.\n- According to British intelligence, the recent explosion of a\

      \ by Russian personnel. In fact, satellite images show no evidence of external\

      led by Vladimir Medinsky, the current chairman of the Russian Commission for
      Historical Education, who, among other things, has in the past denied Russian
      war crimes in Buche or declared that Russians are exceptional because they have
      "one extra chromosome". An odd number of chromosomes is a guarantee of sterility
      in nature, and in humans it is typically manifested, for example, by Down''s
      syndrome. In short, the elite. According to the Russian media, the Russian delegation
      is also due to arrive in Turkey with the head of the Russian GRU, Kostyukov,
      who, according to many analysts, is behind a number of actions abroad, including
      the influence on the US elections and the poisoning of former agent Skripal
      in Britain. Zelensky, on the other hand, is accompanied in Turkey by intelligence
      chief Malyuk, defence minister Umerov and chief of the general staff Hnatov.
      Journalists asked Donald Trump about Putin''s absence during his trip to Qatar.
      His answer? "I''m not disappointed, on the contrary, I predicted it, and I even
      said that I don''t know what he would do if I''m not there. I said I didn''t
      think he would arrive if I didn''t go, and that''s exactly what happened." In
      any case, it is possible that Trump will show up in Turkey tomorrow "if there
      is a shift in the negotiations." Putin will probably never show up. Zelensky
      announced this morning that further steps would be decided after he meets with
      President Erdogan. In the meantime, this also happened [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02ScP8jnDpQem53PySQ9vjSMBeo3rjU5rdu8eed2jtkv9U9WThkobX9rXKi8XFSyaJl):

      intelligence, current presidential advisor Podolyak and even former Moldovan
      Prime Minister Filat. After all, contacts with Russian intelligence are entirely
      consistent with Simion''s pro-Russian positions.

      - Nikolai Vilkov, a 29-year-old Russian, stole a $2.5 million yacht in Florida
      and tried to flee with it to the Bahamas. But the Coast Guard and police apprehended

      in the US in 2022. But his wife and children flew back to Russia last week.

      - The European Union has agreed on the shape of a 17th package of sanctions
      against Russia. It imposes sanctions on, among others, 189 tankers from Russia''s

      UAE that help Russia circumvent existing sanctions.

      - The European Parliament has opened an investigation into the trip of five

      Mechanical signed a memorandum on the licensed production of certain weapons
      systems in factories in Ukraine.

      - The Russians moved the fighting from the Kursk region to the Ukrainian side
      of the border to the village of Loknya. But according to videos of Russian soldiers,
      they are unable to hold their positions and are likely pulling back across the
      border.

      - According to Kellogg, the United States has discussed with Britain, France
      and Germany the potential deployment of troops to the western bank of the Dnieper
      under the banner of the so-called "Resilience force."

      - A Chinese firm owned by the same people as Bytedance (TikTok) bought Trump''s

    desc: 'As expected, Putin has turned tail and announced that he will not fly to
      Istanbul for Thursday''s meeting with Zelensky, which he initiated, and will
      not even consider it. According to some Russian media, Lavrov and Ushakov are
      going to Turkey, but Zelensky had clearly announced in advance that he would
      meet only with Putin and no one else. So Zelensky''s bet worked this time. Russian
      propaganda may be scrambling to come up with some plausible excuse why Putin
      cannot go to Istanbul, but none has yet fallen on deaf ears, making Putin look
      like a coward, which was exactly Zelensky''s intention. Unfortunately, there
      is one more variable: Trump. He has announced in exasperation that if the two
      leaders do not meet immediately, the United States will walk out of the peace
      talks altogether, which would only be a punishment for Russia if it actually
      wanted dialogue, which it does not. And so such a possible move would only harm
      Ukraine again. The crown to all this was put on by Witkoff, who said that even
      the Russians want a peaceful resolution to the conflict, adding that the whole
      war is stupid and would never have happened if it weren''t for election fraud,
      reviving the Trump team''s outrageous lie about a rigged US election. And this
      is what happened too [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0AH6PTMdZeJoM4JWAxTammhArBe5sgzNnXuVoxX8e6zxrVmddSxiFvhZ3Uc77cPmvl):

    detail: '- The Russian propagandist Solovyov claimed on his programme that a Russian
      soldier told him that "the heads of seven children" had been discovered in the
      village of Russkoye Porechnoye near Kursk. Russia, having pushed the Ukrainians
      away from Kursk, is desperate to create its own "Bucha" to sell to the Fifth
      Column in the West as proof of the brutality of the Ukrainian army, and this
      is far from the first or last such story. The fact is, however, that there were
      no killings of civilians, as dozens of Western journalists who have been with
      Ukrainian troops in the areas of fighting can attest.

      - The French actor Gérard Depardieu, who became a Russian propagandist in his
      old age and even acquired Russian citizenship, has been sentenced to a suspended
      18-month prison sentence in France for two counts of sexual assault. It is becoming
      a widespread norm that sexual rapists and deviants seek refuge in Russia.

      - Tonight the Russians launched one of the smallest airstrikes on Ukraine in
      a very long time. There were only 10 kamikaze drones and decoy targets in the
      air. All of them were shot down by Ukrainian air defense. But the debris from
      one drone injured an elderly man near Zaporozhye.

      - The Czech police, in cooperation with the Ukrainian SBU, broke up a criminal
      group of 70 people operating in Ukraine who were organising fraud involving
      fake investment websites and depriving gullible people of tens of millions of
      crowns.

      - The Hungarian prosecutor''s office raided several army barracks, seizing documents
      and computers, but declined to say what the raids were about or whether anyone
      had been charged with anything.

      - Russia is preparing a new law that would allow it to seize the property of
      Russians living abroad for "crimes against the interests of the Russian Federation".

      - A London court sent a group of Bulgarian citizens behind bars for five to
      10 years for spying for Russia in the country.

      - Russia is currently short of a record 2.6 million workers. It is trying to
      address the situation by importing labour from third world countries.

      - The International Civil Aviation Organisation has confirmed that Russia was
      responsible for the downing of flight MH-17 in 2014.

      - Two Ukrainian citizens are among those prosecuted for the fire at a shopping
      centre in Warsaw.

      - The European Union bans a total of 25 tankers from the Russian shadow fleet
      from sailing in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.

    desc: 'After a year-long investigation, Poland has confirmed that Russian intelligence
      was behind last year''s arson attack on the Marywilska shopping centre in Warsaw.
      The fire completely destroyed 1 400 shops and services. Investigators came to
      the same conclusion as the Polish and Lithuanian secret services immediately
      after the fire, namely that Russian intelligence ordered the fire and recruited
      local collaborators to carry out the attack. Some of the perpetrators have since
      been arrested, and more are being sought. In any case, Poland reacted to the
      findings of the investigation by closing the Russian consulate in Krakow, which
      the Russians commented on by saying that "Poland is destroying mutual diplomatic
      relations". The communication manual has simply not changed: fascists always
      put themselves in the role of the victim, even if they are in fact the perpetrators.

    desc: 'Putin delivered what he announced in advance would be an important speech
      to the nation in front of the cameras yesterday. For the first time in it he
      used the phrase not "special military operation" but "war". But the main thing
      was that he rejected the proposed 30-day ceasefire and instead called for peace
      talks to begin on May 15 in Istanbul directly with Ukrainian representatives.
      He also reaffirmed that the North Koreans were fighting in the Kursk region
      and accused Ukraine of violating the non-aggression agreement on energy infrastructure,
      which, of course, Russia itself has been violating since the first seconds of
      its alleged validity. At first glance, the Russian move looks like a friendly
      gesture, but Ushakov said Putin wants to resume dialogue in Istanbul on the
      basis of the terms Russia presented there in 2022. And in that case, this is
      not a path to peace, but a demand for Ukraine''s complete surrender. Moreover,
      according to the Ukrainian Center for Combating Disinformation, Putin will not
      agree to a ceasefire because he has already set in motion plans for the Russian
      summer offensive, which he does not want to cancel. Donald Trump, with his traditional
      naiveté, welcomed the Russian proposal and urged Zelensky to give the nod to
      the talks because, he said, it would at least show which side was serious about
      its peace proposals. Zelensky, to the surprise of all involved, immediately
      announced that he would be waiting for Putin in person in Istanbul on May 15,
      whether he arrived or not, thus cornering him perfectly. And that''s what''s
      happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0YaMmksvViZncy63JLUHMVz44ZV8R9SAD187gyU1NVqrgTcJVDRJDs3u5XEoVCxJwl):

      '
    detail: '- The Russian fifth column in Europe has started to label pro-Ukrainian
      personalities as collaborators. This is not confusion or misunderstanding of
      the meaning of the word. Russian propaganda has similarly emptied words such
      as ''fascist'', ''Nazi'' or, conversely, ''patriot'' or ''warmonger''. The emptying
      out of terms is a coordinated action and one of the basic components of the
      Russian psychological operation. For when words are stripped of their meanings,
      it is easier to label any lies or amoral attitudes as mere "dissent", which
      in a democracy must be protected as part of freedom of speech.

      - The Russians claim to have detained two teenagers in Novokuznetsk who were
      working with Ukrainian intelligence and planning a bomb attack on a military
      commissariat. Ukraine allegedly promised them 4 000 roubles in return. That
      is roughly 50 dollars or 1 200 crowns. So not only is the story probably fictitious,
      but it also reveals, somewhat ironically, what is big money for Russian citizens.

      - Tomio Okamura has begun to use the argument extensively that ethnic Russians
      lived in the Donbas and therefore it is legitimate that Russia wants to annex
      the areas. Meanwhile, the same argument - about ethnic Germans - was used by
      Hitler at the dawn of the Second World War for the subsequent occupation of
      the Sudetenland or the invasion of Poland.

      - Over the weekend, a so-called "Conservative Camp" was held, in fact a meeting
      of all the disseminators of Russian propaganda in the Czech Republic. Among
      the guests were Erik Best, Daniel Vávra, Petr Drulák, Radek Vondráček, Tomio
      Okamura, Filip Turek, Daniel Sterzik and others.

      - In the past, the newly elected Pope Leo XIV has described the war in Ukraine
      as an imperialist invasion aimed at usurping foreign territory based on the
      conviction of his own power and superiority.

      - The United States has given the green light for Germany to hand over 125 HIMARS
      missiles and 100 Patriot missiles to Ukraine.

      - The Russians have begun using new kamikaze drones with jet engines. Their
      target has so far been primarily Odessa.

      - Putin thanked the leaders of the military junta in Burkina Faso for their
      country''s contribution in defeating Nazi Germany.

      - The Trump-negotiated ceasefire between India and Pakistan lasted about five
      hours before the first explosions were heard.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 60 of the 108 Russian kamikaze drones
      last night. Another 41 drones crashed.

      - In Karlovy Vary, a petition was started to rename Moskevska Street to Jiri
      Bartoska Street.

      - The Ukrainians hit the operational headquarters of Russian forces in Rylsk
      in the Kursk region with missiles.

      - Britain will supply Ukraine with five more Raven air defence systems.

    desc: 'Russia is probably struggling to produce modern weapon systems, but it
      is producing an increasing volume of "simpler" weapons such as guns on shells
      or mortars, and most importantly, it is mobilising tens of thousands of people
      every month. Dutch intelligence therefore estimates that Russia is now producing
      more artillery systems than it realistically needs for its invasion of Ukraine.
      It therefore warns that, if the fighting in Ukraine stops, it will take Russia
      only a year to fully rearm. The intelligence agency also warns that the Russians
      have started to build new bases close to NATO borders, especially near the borders
      of Finland and the Baltic states, and urges European countries to be prepared
      for a possible clash. And there''s more [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02EbcsqMB6Nf7oLQfDVPv9mYmaanJYXtJfKhaenb4bmfXNesMZE7CEES6vCQS24kcCl):

    detail: '- Merz, Macron, Tusk and Starmer arrived in Kiev for a meeting of the
      so-called "coalition of the willing". After the meeting, they announced that
      Ukraine had agreed to an unconditional ceasefire starting on 12 May. The European
      leaders also promised to increase pressure on Moscow if Russia does not agree
      to the ceasefire. Kremlin spokesman Peskov let it be known that Russia will
      agree to a ceasefire if the West stops supplying weapons to Ukraine.

      - Hungarian journalist Szabolcs Panyi says Hungarian intelligence services have
      been working hard on Ukraine for several years. Even more so than Russia, which
      is waging a hybrid war against Europe. Within NATO, he says, the Hungarians
      regularly share intelligence on Ukraine in large volumes, but the relevance
      of their information is also very low.

      - In his recent speech, the German President condemned the Russian lies about
      the invasion of Ukraine and the false parallels between Russian aggression and
      the actions of the Red Army during the Second World War. At the same time, he
      criticised Trump for the fact that America under his leadership has abandoned
      the common values that united the West after the defeat of Nazism.

      - Hungary expels two Ukrainian diplomats for alleged espionage in response to
      yesterday''s detention of two agents in Transcarpathia working with Hungarian
      military intelligence. Ukraine has announced that it will expel two Hungarian
      diplomats from Ukraine in return. So far, 4:2 for Ukraine.

      - Germany''s Rheinmetall will reportedly produce satellites capable of mapping
      the battlefield that could provide key information to Ukraine if the United
      States blocks the exchange again. Production of the satellites is due to begin
      next year.

      - The Kremlin has confirmed that a dialogue with the United States is underway
      about the potential resumption of Russian gas supplies to Europe. Both sides
      seem to have forgotten that Europe does not want Russian gas no matter what
      they agree.

      - Ukraine has imposed sanctions on 58 other individuals and 74 companies that
      help the Russian arms industry. These include entities from Uzbekistan, Iran
      and China.

      - Britain has used the experience and data of the Ukrainians to introduce its
      own AI-powered Kraken3 drone, capable of launching FPV drones.

      - The US embassy in Kiev warned its compatriots of a likely massive Russian
      airstrike in the coming days.

      - In his May 9 speech, Putin described occupied Sevastopol and Ukraine''s Odessa
      as "part of Russia''s historical legacy."

      - The old Soviet Kosmos-482 spacecraft crashed into the Indian Ocean without
      causing any damage.

      - Denmark will allocate €830 million to the EU. Denmark will use €830 million
      from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets to buy weapons for Ukraine.

      - Western intelligence claims that Iran is about to hand over Fath-360 ballistic
      missile launchers to Russia.

      - Germany has announced that further arms deliveries to Ukraine will be carried

    desc: 'Yesterday''s scandalous revelations in Hungary have their continuation
      directly in Ukraine. Ukraine''s SBU announced that it had uncovered and detained
      a pair of Hungarian military intelligence agents operating in Transcarpathia,
      whose task was to gather information on the location of Ukrainian defensive
      positions, air defence sites, potential weaknesses in Ukrainian defences, vehicles
      belonging to members of the Ukrainian army, Ukrainian combat losses, as well
      as the mood of the local Hungarian minority and its attitude towards a potential
      Hungarian military intervention. One of the detainees is a retired Ukrainian
      army officer. According to investigators, he regularly travelled to Hungary
      to meet with senior officers from Hungarian intelligence. The other also has
      a history in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Both face charges of espionage and
      treason. The Hungarian foreign minister, who regularly travels to Moscow for
      meetings, said he had not yet received any official information from Ukraine
      and described the incident as Ukrainian propaganda. Anyway, [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0nnTU6WEXg6jT7Nc4rbEktdTJmpYXv6MfRUNCQnJwU6FSp9hKYqDKaMVQwSGDC136l)

    desc: 'Hungary is being rocked by a new scandal of the Orbán administration that
      goes far beyond Hungary''s borders. The opposition has released leaked recordings
      from April 2023 in which Kristóf Szalay-Bobrovniczky, an army officer and current
      defence minister in Orbán''s government, declares that he will put the army
      in a state of war, end the current peacekeeping missions Hungary is participating
      in within NATO, and "end Hungary''s peaceful stance". The recording further
      shows that Szalay-Bobrovniczky carried out a purge in the army, during which
      officers loyal to the North Atlantic Alliance were identified and fired (Szalay-Bobrovniczky
      called it ''rejuvenation of the army'' for the media), with the ultimate aim
      of bringing the country to the so-called ''phase zero'' on the road to war.
      It is not clear what kind of conflict the Orbán government was preparing for,
      but there is speculation that Orbán may have been preparing the army to invade
      western Ukraine if the Ukrainian defences collapsed, with the aim of taking
      Transcarpathia, where the Hungarian minority lives. Indeed, Transcarpathia is
      often used by Orbán to criticise the current Ukrainian leadership for allegedly
      suppressing the rights of ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine. Szalay-Bobrovniczky
      now claims that he was only trying to modernise the army and make it combat
      capable. But this does not refute the allegations that have arisen over the
      recording. And then there was [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02H4nvPLiKwjzXt3i6bhz4qXjSCXFGqfb8K2akVyDJ9muNWLVPyfdxgtkmHqXwhogjl):

      the stroke of midnight, but it never happened and artillery fire, shootouts
      and FPV drone attacks continued on practically the entire front. Also during
      the night, 31 kamikaze drones flew into Ukraine. 20 were shot down by the Ukrainian
      Air Defense Forces and 6 others crashed.

      - Christopher Garrett, a British engineer who had been working in Ukraine as
      a volunteer since 2014 helping to clear mines and unexploded ordnance, was killed
      while disposing of an explosive that exploded under his hands.

      - U.S. intelligence services have reportedly been ordered to expand their activities
      in Greenland and gather information on the independence movement there. Denmark
      has summoned the American ambassador for information.

      - The Lithuanian Parliament passed a resolution pledging never to recognise
      the annexation of the occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia, even if this were
      to take place within the framework of a peace settlement.

      - Dostal announced that he would also travel to Moscow on 8 May. He cited as
      his three reasons paying tribute to fallen soldiers in World War II, the wishes
      of his constituents and a desire for peace.

      - April has been the deadliest month ever for Ukrainian civilians since at least
      last autumn. Russian airstrikes also killed 19 children and injured 78.

    desc: 'Ukrainian drones again attacked military targets deep inside Russia last
      night. And according to some reports, the attack was truly huge - using up to
      447 drones and missiles. For example, the Splav salvo rocket launcher factory
      near Tula and a nearby machine plant producing parts for the Russian military
      were hit. Another target was a fibre-optic factory in Saransk, where a large
      fire broke out after the strike. The drones also hit Kubinka and Shaykovka airports.
      The Russians have also attacked with their missiles and drones, but these have
      landed in the middle of busy neighbourhoods in Ukrainian cities. In Kiev, an
      attack on an apartment building left two dead and six wounded. Zaporizhzhya
      was also hit, reporting at least four injured after drones and missiles damaged
      seven apartment buildings and 11 family houses. But other Ukrainian towns were
      also hit. And besides, [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02CZfrfXW6Ne26U7KYs8JXUG5r2wkq5uboFC7YGZeCfMr3JbwR8VKSDSfQpCptdDCsl)

      '
    detail: '- Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov has written the foreword to a new book
      "History of Lithuania". In it, he denies the existence of the Lithuanian language
      and Lithuanian statehood, that is, the entire Lithuanian nation. The Lithuanian
      Foreign Ministry described the book as an instrument of aggressive Russian propaganda
      and recalled that similar texts were published in Russia about Ukraine in preparation
      for the later Russian invasion and genocidal war against Ukrainian national
      identity. For us, it is another reminder that Nazi Germany and contemporary
      Russia are similar in more ways than they are different.

      - As a result of the Ukrainian attacks on targets in Russia, not only were all
      four Moscow airports closed, but also those in Volgograd, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara
      and Perm. Passengers are waiting up to half a day to board their planes. Large
      queues of planes are forming on the departure runways waiting to be cleared
      for departure.

      - 8 300 prisoners have already volunteered to join the Ukrainian army, with
      another 1 000 being considered by the authorities. According to Ukrinform, some
      20-30% of Ukrainian prisoners are eligible for possible service in the army
      if they choose it as an alternative form of their sentence.

      - Video from a reconnaissance drone captured another Russian war crime. During
      an attack on trenches in the Donetsk region, a group of Russian soldiers captured
      a trio of Ukrainian soldiers and surrounded and shot them unarmed.

      - Poland''s minister for digitalisation announced at a press conference that
      Russia is stepping up its disinformation campaigns against Poland and cyberattacks
      on Polish institutions in an attempt to influence the upcoming presidential
      election.

      - Ramzan Kadyrov asked Putin to accept his resignation as head of the Chechen
      Republic. It seems that Kadyrov''s teenage son Adam is expected to take over
      power in the country afterwards.

      - A court case has begun in Canada to decide on the confiscation of a detained
      Russian An-124 Ruslan aircraft and its possible transfer to Ukraine.

      - India launched its "counter-terrorism operation" against Pakistan. 26 people
      were killed in the initial raid on Kashmir and dozens more were injured.

      - The European Parliament waived the immunity of Czech-born German MEP Petr
      Bystron. He faces charges of corruption and money laundering.

      - ATMs throughout the Moscow region are out of service due to the disconnection
      of the area from the internet in preparation for a military parade.

      - Trump has a new fairy tale about the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
      He says the war started because the powers that be excluded Russia from the
      G8.

      - Latvia, Lithuania and Poland will not allow Slovak and Serbian government
      delegations on their way to Moscow into their airspace.

    desc: 'Simion, the winner of the first round of the Romanian presidential election,
      promises that if he wins he will oppose further arms supplies to Ukraine and
      promote the "peace" sought by the Trump administration. Exactly in the spirit
      of Russian propaganda. Romania is an absolutely key country for Russia, especially
      after its failure to influence the elections in Poland. Its aim is to encircle
      Ukraine with countries that will be hostile to Ukraine and, in turn, open to
      cooperation with Russia. That is why it is spending huge resources on psychological
      operations targeting the population there. Hungary has already fallen in this
      information war, as have Slovakia and parts of Moldova. Belarus has always been
      a satellite of Russia. In Poland, fortunately, anti-Russian sentiment is strong,
      so Russian propaganda has less influence there and must try to gain influence
      through other, generally conservative themes. However, if Romania loses its
      information war with Russia, one can expect a sharp increase in disinformation
      campaigns in Poland to complete the encirclement of Ukraine. The Czech Republic
      may not have a border with Ukraine, but even we will not be spared a giant wave
      of disinformation this year, lest the next government be composed of pro-Russian
      ANO entities. Our inability to defend ourselves will one day be our gravedigger.

      \ for a potential clash with Russia. Not because it wants to, but because Russian\
      \ officials and regime propagandists are daily calling for nuclear war, a campaign\
      \ on Berlin, the wiping of Britain off the map and a new Soviet Union stretching\
      \ \"from Lisbon to Vladivostok\". It is also true that attempts are being made\

    desc: 'Russian military bloggers are reporting that the Ukrainian army has again
      crossed the border of the Kursk region, this time near the village of Tyotkino
      further northwest of the last sortie. The raid was preceded by a nighttime artillery
      preparation during which the Ukrainians hit several bridges on potential Russian
      supply routes near the towns of Tyotkino and Zvannoye. Then heavy equipment
      prepared passage through Russian anti-tank barriers and Ukrainian soldiers on
      combat vehicles began to flow into Russia. In total, the assault group is said
      to consist of around 250 soldiers, 15 heavy armoured vehicles and light vehicles.
      Heavy fighting is now taking place in border villages on the Russian side of
      the border. In addition, [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02WyCRqfUfq4iCf392n6yfYMgbQTm7igiKvH3ywps1wk1ZcGCSZDzvuHZ7o1VFcQ9Ll)
      happened:

      '
    detail: '- A new documentary on Putin was released yesterday in Russia, titled
      "Russia. Kremlin. Putin. 25 years." At one point in it, the host asks if Putin
      is thinking about his potential successors, to which Putin replies that yes,
      he has a list of potential candidates. Putin thus inadvertently proves that
      Russia is an autocracy where the current autocrat chooses the next one, not
      a democracy where representation is chosen in free elections. After all, Putin
      himself was chosen by his predecessor Yeltsin in 1999.

      - As expected, the pro-Russian candidate Simion of the far-right AUR party won
      the first round of the Romanian presidential elections, but by a larger margin
      than the polls gave him credit for. He took just under 41% of the total votes
      cast. It is therefore possible that American interference has borne fruit. In
      any case, the elections were accompanied by a very low turnout. In the second
      round, Simion will face the centrist mayor of Bucharest, Dan.

      - Analysts have pointed out that recent footage of an alleged Ukrainian drone
      strike on an apartment building in Novorossiysk does not show any landing or
      the typical drone buzz. On the contrary, the video makes it appear as if the
      explosion came from inside the house.

      - Moscow media report that authorities plan to shut down wireless communications
      over all of Moscow during the week in which the main events of this year''s
      celebrations of the end of World War II will take place. In addition, any signal
      will be actively jammed by electronic warfare systems.

      - Ukrainian drones disrupted a parade rehearsal in Moscow last night. Vnukovo
      and Domodedovo airports were closed as a precaution during the attack, and Russian
      air defense forces worked over the area.

      - According to new information, Putin will not attend the Red Square parade
      in person. He will only speak to the people remotely via large screens.

      - Zelensky said at a press conference with Pavel that the Czech munitions initiative
      has the potential to provide Ukraine with about 1.8 million shells this year.

      - According to the NYT, the United States plans to withdraw two Patriot system
      batteries from Israel, repair them, and then provide them to Ukraine.

      - The OPEC+ group will increase oil production in June. This should lead to
      a lower price on world markets, which will inevitably weaken Russia.

      - According to Bloomberg, the EU is planning to ban all imports of Russian gas,
      either by pipeline or in the form of LNG by sea.

      - Trump claims that European leaders have asked him to call Putin because they
      say Putin is not answering their phones.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 42 of 116 Russian kamikaze drones overnight.
      Another 21 drones crashed.

      - 11 people were injured after a Russian drone landed on a block of flats in
      Kiev''s Obolon district.

      - Russians preemptively cancel planned May 9 celebrations in occupied Sevastopol.

      - The Russians moved 280 air defense systems to Moscow for a planned parade.

      - Boris Pistorius will remain as defence minister in the new German government.

      - The Russians dropped a guided aerial bomb on a fire station in Kupyansk.

      - Trump said that if it wasn''t for him, the whole of Ukraine would be fighting
      today.

    desc: 'The so called Night Wolves are once again on their ride across Europe.
      Yesterday, they crossed the border into Slovakia and later arrived in Bratislava,
      where they were met by protesting opponents of Russia and around five dozen
      supporters. They were accompanied by Slovak police throughout. They are expected
      to arrive in the Czech Republic today, visit several places in Moravia and later
      head to Prague. The Night Wolves are not just an ordinary motorcycle club. They
      have direct links to President Putin, whom they also actively support in every
      campaign and from whom they receive millions in return for organising nationalist
      events. During the Russian coup in Crimea, they were involved in clashes with
      Ukrainian activists, for which Putin even honoured them. Some even fought in
      the Donbas with pro-Russian separatists. Chechen dictator Ramzan Kadyrov has
      also been a member of the club since 2014. Analysts describe them as ultra-conservative
      ultra-orthodox ultranationalists. Their annual ride from Moscow to Berlin is
      meant to symbolize the Red Army''s campaign in World War II. In fact, it is
      a mystery that, with the Russian invasion under way, such groups are allowed
      to enter EU territory at all. But let''s also go to another [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid023AbouqRRgeWv37ScTaQxSkG8x2ceWNpoBxViUyrg2sfVKs6FGMWNMfdQoxAyCsakl):

    detail: '- The first round of the Romanian presidential by-election takes place.
      The United States is trying to influence the vote by announcing, on the very
      day that the polls open, that it is suspending visa-free travel with Romania.
      The far-right candidate Simion, who is seen as the successor to the ousted Georgescu,
      is in fact staunchly pro-MAGA, maintains contacts with the Trump team and promised
      voters that visa-free travel would be restored "as soon as Romania returns to
      democracy", by which he meant, of course, as soon as Romanians elect him. Polls
      so far suggest that Simion could win the first round, but he is still likely
      to be defeated in the second.

      - Fico says he is going to Moscow for the celebrations, but he says some countries
      will not allow him to fly over their territory. Fico also described recent remarks
      by Zelensky advising statesmen not to travel to Moscow as a threat.

      - Russia unilaterally decided to introduce direct flights from Moscow to the
      city of Sukhumi in Georgia''s occupied Abkhazia. The EU strongly criticised
      the decision.

      - For security reasons, Lithuania will withdraw residence permits from Russian
      and Belarusian citizens who travel to their home countries more than once every
      three months.

      - Zelensky claims that Ukraine shot down not one but two Russian fighter jets
      yesterday. One over the Black Sea near Novorossiysk, the other over Crimea.

      - The Ukrainian drones hit the Russian Strela electronics plant near Bryansk,
      which makes components for radars and other military electronics.

      - Putin said Russia had enough resources to complete a "special military operation"
      without using nuclear weapons.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 69 of 165 Russian kamikaze drones overnight.
      Another 80 drones crashed.

      - According to the Ukrainian military, the Russians are planning to deploy North
      Koreans to fight in eastern and southern Ukraine.

      - After Trump lost the election to the Conservatives in Canada, he lost it to
      the Conservatives in Australia.

      - Trump has said he is "closer to one side on the Ukraine war, but won''t say
      which side."

      - A "March of the Immortals" organised by the Russian diaspora there passed
      through Washington.

      - Zelensky flew to Prague for a state visit.

      24 hours. The targets have been military installations of the Russian army,
      from naval bases to airports to air defence stations. Explosions have been reported
      in Sevastopol, Dzhankoy, Saky, Novofedorivka, Kacha and other locations. While
      it is not yet clear what was hit and to what extent, new videos of past attacks
      have emerged in parallel, showing that the Russians have lost a significant
      portion of their air defense systems in recent weeks, including some very advanced
      or otherwise valuable pieces. So the Ukrainians have probably assessed that
      a possible major strike could be successful due to the weakened Russian defenses
      and have set things in motion. So it will be interesting to see what damage
      the latest attack has done. And then there was [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02q5aZMDbjNP3LA4N2epYfsRjEsXWJTM7uzvjaxtqCB83UKixdW1Pvsw6gsiNPa4ZAl):

      the main points on which the two sides have agreed? Primarily: 1) Ukraine''s
      mineral wealth will remain the property of Ukraine. 2) A special investment
      fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine will be set up, to which both sides will
      contribute equally and both will have the same number of representatives on
      the fund''s board. 3) Ukraine will not compensate the United States for assistance

      EU, then the treaty will immediately expire. 5) Ukraine will pay 50% of the
      proceeds of new investments in mineral, gas and oil extraction into the fund.
      The US will actively seek new investors and investment funds and neither side
      will tax the funds invested. The agreement has already been approved by the
      Ukrainian government and will soon be voted on by the Ukrainian parliament.

      of the war than, for example, J. D. Vance: ''Russia is not winning this war.
      Russia has made no significant progress in the last year and a half. It has
      lost hundreds of thousands of troops and hasn''t really moved anywhere. It is
      moving in metres, not kilometres. And the Ukrainians are fighting on their own
      territory and fighting hard. So when Russia says it''s winning, no, it''s not.
      If it was winning, it would have already won the war. So I think the Russians
      should calm down and realize that. I think Ukraine is in a good position now.
      The Europeans have really taken the initiative." Unfortunately, Trump has sidelined

      Corruption Perceptions Index. Russia is ranked 154th.

      - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claims that the INS, in cooperation
      with Musk''s "DOGE," detained two Ukrainian citizens who voted in violation
      of the law in the last presidential election. But she did not provide any details
      about her claim.

      Ukraine along the current front. But Putin refused, demanding that the remaining
      parts of the areas he considers "his" by virtue of the illegal annexation be
      ceded to Russia.

      North Koreans on the front, they will only increase in number and will also
      appear in the future with their own equipment and support troops.

      going on:

      '
    detail: '- Careful, unpleasant reading. According to Ukrainian investigators,
      journalist Viktoria Roshchina, who was kidnapped by the Russians in Zaporozhye
      region in 2023, was brutally tortured before her death. And to cover up the
      effects of the torture, the Russians handed over Viktoria''s remains, which
      were missing her eyes, brain and part of her larynx, to Ukraine. Yet bruises
      and welts were visible on her body, her ribs were broken, and there were signs
      of strangulation and electrical burns. Viktoria was abducted while she was gathering
      information about the involvement of the Russian FSB in the kidnapping of Ukrainians.
      She probably died on 19 September 2024 from the effects of torture in a prison
      near Taganrog. Her remains were returned to Ukraine in February 2025, after
      DNA tests found a match for the body, which the Russians listed in morgue records
      as "the body of an unknown man".

      - Ukraine has launched the "Brave1 Market" project, a special official marketplace
      designed for the army, where individual formations can buy necessary equipment
      beyond the equipment and weapons they receive, i.e. with their own funds. An
      army spokesman calls it "Amazon for soldiers". Around a thousand different items
      are currently available - from drones to electronic warfare systems, parts,
      AI technology, software and ammunition.

      - In a podcast by pro-Russian propagandist and conspiracy theorist Charlie Kirk,
      J.D. Vance said that "there is a strange notion in the media that if the war
      continues, Russia will eventually collapse and Ukraine will regain its territory."
      But, he said, "this is not the reality we live in" and, on the contrary, there
      is a threat of nuclear war if the war does not end quickly.

      - Russian pensioners living in Latvia complain that Russia has stopped sending
      them pensions. Only nine people out of approximately four thousand have received
      their pensions. In total, Russia has sent only €21,000 out of the €3.5 million
      needed.

      - Ukrainian soldiers claim that wiretaps of Russian communications show that
      the Russians have been ordered to infiltrate the Dnipropetrovsk region by 9
      May, or all commanders will be imprisoned, they say.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 37 of 100 Russian kamikaze drones overnight.
      Another 47 drones crashed. Eight people died and 24 others were injured in the
      night raid. Among the dead is a 12-year-old child.

      - The Russians reportedly shot dead a Belarusian man, Pavel Glukhov, whom they
      had recruited for the war in Ukraine in a prison colony because he refused to
      be part of the "human wave" at the front.

      - In an interview with the Atlantic, Trump said he believed he was doing Ukraine
      a tremendous service by protecting it from Russia crushing the entire Ukrainian
      nation in a heartbeat.

      - Medvedev, speaking at the conference, said that only a Russian victory in
      a "special military operation" separates the world from a new, great, stable
      world order.

      - An oil terminal in the port of Novorossiysk is on fire. But it is unclear
      whether it was a drone strike, sabotage, or another in a series of "accidents"
      by Russian smokers.

      - There are still 59 Abrams tanks in Australia, which the government there plans
      to provide to Ukraine. But their transfer is being held up by the United States.

      - China, North Korea''s largest trading partner, has refused to comment on the
      information about North Korean soldiers in Russia.

      - France has convened the UN Security Council over Russian attacks on civilians
      in Ukraine.

      - Ukraine offered Spain assistance, and especially experience in rebuilding
      its energy system.

      - Trump inadvertently handed the Liberals an election victory in Canada.

    desc: 'Putin officially thanked his "North Korean friends" for their solidarity,
      brotherhood and heroic deeds in the fighting at Kursk. For a change, North Korea
      officially announced the deployment of its troops in the Kursk region on the
      basis of Article 4 of the Mutual Defence Treaty with the Russian Federation.
      Kim Jong-un called it a ''holy mission''. Meanwhile, Russia has so far denied
      the presence of North Koreans and its useful idiots have flooded the debate
      with claims that there is no evidence of North Korean deployment to fight Ukraine
      and that this is just Ukrainian propaganda. This example illustrates so perfectly
      that Russia lies all the time and about everything (little green men in Crimea,
      soldiers on holiday, there will be no invasion, we didn''t shoot down any planes...
      etc.) and its sympathisers apparently don''t mind or are unwilling to admit
      it, although the same people feel, somewhat ironically, that everyone on the
      other side of the barricade is lying to them. And when Russia is convicted of
      one lie, they just seamlessly move on to parroting another lie. It also answers
      the occasional question of why this site has almost stopped using Russian sources
      of information. Simply because it has been proven over time that they lie -
      no exaggeration - on 9 news stories out of 10, and that the one true story can
      be found on Ukrainian channels. As a result, the accuracy of the information
      in each daily summary has increased noticeably. And no, there is really no need
      to look for "truth somewhere halfway" between truth and lies. And now for more
      [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02SzNVCHkXgLQLLREHFaYZqL4FXgvGQ3KDB6aeoGLAKXWo7mmfmjmpeiqhBwaEpxul):

      '
    detail: '- In an interview with the Brazilian daily O Globo, Lavrov announced
      what it would take for Putin to agree to peace talks. He essentially repeated
      Russian demands from the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine: A ban on Ukraine
      joining NATO, an end to the "Nazi regime" in Kiev and its suppression of all
      things Russian, recognition of Crimea and the four occupied regions as part
      of Russia, demilitarization and "de-Nazification" of Ukraine, the lifting of
      all anti-Russian sanctions, and security guarantees for Russia against alleged
      NATO threats.

      - Forbes magazine interviewed several historians and experts on Russia or the
      Eastern European region. All agreed that Ukraine''s desire to join NATO is not
      the reason for the Russian invasion, as the Kremlin (and MAGA politicians, including
      Trump) claim. In fact, Russian ambitions to conquer Ukraine were there long
      before Ukraine even started speculating about possible membership.

      - German Defense Minister Pistorius criticized the US peace initiative. He said
      Ukraine does not need American help to capitulate. Pistorius also assured Ukraine
      that Germany would continue to send it military aid even if the United States
      left.

      - For the umpteenth time, Ukrainian drones have hit the Kremny EL electronics
      plant in Bryansk, which supplies electronic components to the Russian military.
      Something has also been hit in Rostov-on-Don. The Russian air defense claims
      to have successfully shot down 101 Ukrainian drones.

      - President Pavel told the "patriots" that if someone says he cares about the
      Czech Republic, but at the same time makes no secret of the fact that he would
      not go to defend it, it means that he does not care about the Czech Republic.

      - Estonia is building a new factory near the city of Pärnu, which should in
      the future produce around 600 tonnes of RDX explosives a year for the needs
      of European munitions factories.

      - The Kremlin has published a list of prominent foreign guests at the celebrations
      marking the end of the "Great Patriotic War". Fico is not missing, but Orbán
      is missing for now.

      - Ukraine lost a Su-27 fighter jet this morning while repelling a Russian airstrike.
      The pilot managed to eject in time and survived the crash.

      - According to Prime Minister Shmyhal, the new version of the mineral agreement
      does not include the value of the aid provided by the United States so far.

      - Trump believes that Zelensky is ready to give up Crimea.

    desc: 'Lavrov said Russia would agree to an unconditional ceasefire if the West
      stopped supplying weapons to Ukraine. So Lavrov probably does not understand
      what the word "unconditional" means. But he also commented on some other points
      of the proposed peace plan: Crimea, he said, is an integral part of Russia and
      Russia will not negotiate over its territories. The Zaporizhzhya nuclear power
      plant is already in the best hands and handing it over to anyone else is said
      to be impossible. Moscow is said to be ready to seek a "balance" between the
      interests of the two opposing sides. Let us recall for the sake of argument
      that the entire Russian invasion of Ukraine is criminal and Russia has no right
      to demand anything. So any "balance" will mean that Russia will gain something
      and Ukraine will lose. And the West should not allow that to happen. But now

      or the portraits of the leaders of these countries and organisations during
      the celebrations of the end of the Second World War from 8 to 9 May.

      - According to the latest poll, only 22% of Americans fully support Trump''s
      actions, while 39% support Trump overall (i.e. with reservations). Trump is
      thus not only the least popular president in American history, but has also
      "broken" his own record again.

      - U.S. Senator Graham announced that he has a bill in the works that has bipartisan
      support in the U.S. Congress that would impose secondary sanctions against any
      country that purchases Russian oil, gas, uranium and other raw materials. All
      Trump has to do is give it the green light.

      died and four others were injured in the airstrike. A total of 21 houses were
      damaged.

      of rapid assaults on motorcycles. This perfectly illustrates the state of the
      Russian army''s vehicle fleet.

      - The British have developed a new anti-drone weapon that can use microwaves
      to "fry" dozens of drones simultaneously.

      - A Russian commander denied the Kremlin''s information, admitting that Ukrainians
      are still fighting in the Kursk region.

    desc: 'Ukraine, in cooperation with Europe, presented its own version of the peace
      plan to the United States: Ceasefire: Immediate and unconditional ceasefire
      on all fronts. It will be supervised by the United States or Western partners.
      Russia will return all children abducted from occupied territories and there
      will be an all-for-all exchange of prisoners. Security: Ukraine will be given
      similar guarantees to those given in Article 5 of the NATO treaty. Ukraine''s
      armed forces will not be reduced in any way, nor will they be forcibly reorganised.
      Ukraine itself will decide on the presence of foreign allied troops on its territory.
      Ukraine will not be prevented from joining the EU. Territories: Negotiations
      on territories will only take place after the ceasefire has been implemented.
      Ukraine will recover the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and the Kakhovka hydroelectric
      power plant. Ukraine will regain the Kinburn Scythe and be guaranteed free navigation
      on the Dnieper. Economy: Ukraine will establish cooperation with the United
      States on the basis of a mineral agreement. Ukraine will receive full funding
      for the reconstruction of destroyed cities and infrastructure, partly from frozen
      Russian funds, which will remain frozen until full compensation for damages
      is made. Sanctions against Russia can only be gradually released once a lasting

    detail: '- The Kyiv Independent interviewed several military observers and soldiers
      fighting on the front themselves, and they all more or less agree that although
      Russia is still attacking in small groups along virtually the entire front,
      the situation is far from such that Ukraine should be pressured into signing
      a disadvantageous peace deal. The front is virtually immobile despite the Russian
      army''s spring offensive, and Russia is paying heavy casualties for every metre
      of Ukrainian territory.

      - The parliamentary foreign policy committees of seven European countries have
      issued a joint statement urging Trump not to repeat the mistake that was the
      Munich Agreement. The seven countries include Ukraine, the Baltic states, Britain,

      - The Russians held an exhibition of captured Western machines in Komsomolsk-on-Amur.
      However, one of the M113 transporters had a poorly secured dump platform, which

      - The secret Russian satellite Kosmos-2553, which US intelligence said was part
      of a Russian plan to put nuclear weapons into orbit, reportedly crashed and
      is spinning uncontrollably in its orbit.

      - The Americans reportedly rejected a Russian demand to withdraw Ukrainian forces
      from four occupied regions. They described it as unfounded and unproductive.
      They should have assured Ukraine that they would not support such a proposal.

      - According to Mr Zelensky, the deadly strike on Kiev was carried out by a North
      Korean missile containing some 116 Western components, with most of the components
      coming from the US.

      - Russia has said it is back in control of the entire Kursk region. But that
      is clearly not true, according to open sources, and there is still fighting
      in several border villages.

      - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has cancelled some
      forms of aid for Ukrainian refugees after the agency lost funding from the United
      States.

    desc: 'Russian Major General Yaroslav Moskalyk was killed in the Moscow region
      by an explosive planted in one of his cars. Moskalyk was deputy chief of the
      Main Operations Directorate of the Russian Army General Staff. The action was
      probably carried out by the Ukrainian secret services. A week ago, a vehicle
      also blew up in Bryansk. As it turned out only today, it killed Yevgeny Ritikov,
      an engineer, head of development at the Bryansk Electrotechnical Plant and chief
      designer of the upgraded 1RL257 Krasucha-4 electronic warfare system. This is
      also what precision attacks on legitimate targets in civilian buildings can
      look like. Unfortunately, Russia prefers to raze entire cities with drones and
      missiles if it means even one single soldier will die in the process. And yet

      happened:

      '
    detail: '- Last April, Michael Gloss, a young American fighting in the Russian
      ranks, was killed at the front. According to new information, he was the son
      of Julian Gallina Gloss, the CIA''s deputy director for digital innovation.
      He came to Russia after becoming involved in hippie communities where he dreamed
      of a "multipolar world," one of Russia''s narratives.

      - Zelensky was interviewed by Ben Shapiro. In it, Zelensky refuted some of Russia''s
      lies about the alleged misappropriation of US aid, and reminded us that it needs
      to be reiterated that it was Russia that started the whole war, not Ukraine,
      as Donald Trump unfortunately claims at times.

      - Kremlin spokesman Peskov told a Russian state television program, "We remind
      you that Russia has never attacked anyone in its entire history. And Russia,
      which itself has survived so many wars, is the last country in Europe that would
      even want to utter the word ''war''."

      - Trump''s former vice president, Mike Pence, responding to the Russian airstrike
      on Kiev, argues that Putin clearly has no desire for peace and therefore the
      US needs to respond with force and provide Ukraine with everything it needs
      to end the war victoriously.

      - Ukrainians in the Black Sea intercepted a cargo ship from Russia''s shadow
      fleet carrying stolen Ukrainian grain from Sevastopol. The crew of the ship
      was arrested and handed over to the authorities for prosecution.

      - Lavrov caused a minor uproar in Uzbekistan when, during a visit to one of
      the memorials, he did not hide his disillusionment at the fact that the inscriptions
      on the memorial were in various languages but not in Russian.

      - Trump commented on his pledge to end the war in Ukraine in one day, "Everybody
      understands I said it as a joke."

      - The United States has warned Russia that its new naval war in Sudan will have
      serious consequences for Russia.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 41 of 103 Russian kamikaze drones overnight.
      Another 40 drones crashed.

      - Russians hit apartment buildings in Pavlohrad. 3 people died on the spot and
      at least 14 were injured.

      - A Trump merch e-store started selling "Trump 2028" hats.

      - SPD supporters attacked a group of Ukrainian students in Brno.

      - Norway will increase aid to Ukraine threefold - to 8 billion euros.

      - Against the backdrop of all this, Pakistan and India are also heading for
      war.

      - Today, Ukrainian drones again attacked targets in Crimea.

      - Trump has declared that Crimea will remain in Russian hands.

      - Witkoff held three hours of talks with Putin in the Kremlin.

    desc: 'The Russians "avenged" the explosion of the ammunition depot in the only
      way they know how: by a massive attack on the civilian population. At one point
      there were 145 kamikaze drones and decoy targets and 70 ballistic missiles and
      cruise missiles in the air. And the target was again Dnipro, but also the Ukrainian
      capital. The air defense took care of 48 missiles of various types and 64 drones
      (68 others crashed), which of course was not enough. Thus, several kamikaze
      drones as well as ballistic missiles, including those that Russia bought from
      North Korea, landed on Kiev last night. The death toll has so far stood at 11
      dead and 113 wounded. The missiles again hit primarily civilian objects in residential

    desc: 'The alleged text of Trump''s peace plan, on which his team has been working
      steadily for the past weeks, has been leaked to the media. And the work is visible
      - I can''t say! Under the plan, the United States will recognize de jure Russian
      control of Crimea and de facto Russian occupation of four Ukrainian territories,
      and Ukraine will be asked to do the same. Furthermore, Ukraine will not be allowed
      to join NATO (which goes directly against the basic open door rule on which
      the entire alliance is based), all sanctions imposed on Russia after 2014 will
      be lifted, the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant will be returned to Ukraine, but
      it will be operated by the United States and will supply energy to both countries.
      And what would Ukraine "gain"? According to the proposal, Russia should withdraw
      (only) from the Kharkiv region and should guarantee free navigation on the Dnieper
      (since recognition of the occupation of the regions is a de facto intermediate
      step to recognition of the claim). Ukraine should subsequently receive "strong
      security guarantees", which are not defined in any concrete way in the proposal,
      as well as funding for the reconstruction of war-damaged cities and infrastructure.
      So we can already say without a doubt that Trump is a Russian agent. Because
      the proposal as it stands means that Russia would get everything it started
      its illegal war for, while Ukraine would get vague "security guarantees". It
      has had one of these in the past. They were called the ''Budapest Memorandum''.
      Under it, the Western powers and Russia were to guarantee Ukraine''s inviolability
      and territorial integrity. And after Putin wiped his behind with it, so did
      Trump, in just a few weeks in office. Munich the rag... And then there was [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0z7tkSdJfq26ULDntAR8TFJ8vSzv9okPzhyGLwsgPAmoKE7XRrFoTWeiaaFQ44DrJl):

    detail: '- Trump''s cabinet removed the coordinator who was in charge of gathering
      information on Russian war crimes in Ukraine. At the same time, an entire team
      under the Justice Department that had been looking into war crimes was disbanded.

      - The Russian authorities initiated legal proceedings against Apple for spreading
      "LGBT propaganda". They are demanding around $42,000 as a fine for Apple offering
      users mobile wallpapers and other rainbow-themed elements during "pride month".

      - Hungary votes in a referendum on Ukraine''s potential admission to the EU.
      Orban, of course, voted no and had his picture taken to motivate others to do
      the same.

      - Ukraine''s Foreign Ministry gave the Chinese ambassador evidence of individuals
      and companies from China producing military material for the Russian military.

      - Negotiations between Ukraine and Western allies are underway in London. The
      US Secretary of State was due to attend the meeting but eventually cancelled
      his participation.

      - The Russians sent a drone strike on a bus carrying workers in the town of
      Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region. 9 people were killed and dozens more
      injured.

      - Ukrainian drones struck the Russian Shahed-136 attack drone factory in Yelabuza
      as far away as Tatarstan.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 67 of 137 Russian kamikaze drones overnight.
      Another 47 drones crashed.

      share information about the airstrikes on Yemen''s Houthis with members of Trump''s
      team on Signal, but also in another chat room where, among others, his relatives
      were present.

      - Russian courts have sent a trio of newly adult students behind bars for 2.6
      years. This is because they spoke out against the war at school and their own
      teacher subsequently turned them in to the authorities for "discrediting the
      military".

      drone."

      that Britons are demonstrating en masse in the streets for Donald Trump.

      Ukrainian Air Defense Forces shot down 42 drones, and another 47 drones crashed.

      - Putin refused to extend the Easter ceasefire. It ended just after midnight

    year: 20 April 2025
    desc: 'You didn''t think the Russians would keep their word and the announced
      "Easter Truce" would actually happen, did you? The Russian army did not for
      a second stop taking offensive action, and Russian artillery, both barrel and
      rocket artillery, was active. Some villages were even under much more intense
      fire than usual. The Pokrovsk-Siversk section of the front reported at least
      26 Russian attacks since morning. In a fraction of the sections, the Russians
      then took advantage of the ceasefire to send sappers to try to detect and remove
      anti-personnel and anti-tank barriers and mines under the pretext of going to
      collect their dead from the battlefield. The whole thing was, in short, a complete
      farce, which had only one purpose: propaganda. The idea was to saturate the
      information space with news of Putin''s good-hearted gesture and, in turn, of
      ungrateful Ukrainians who do not honour the ceasefire. At the same time, Zelensky
      announced that if there really is a ceasefire, Ukraine is ready to extend it
      not for 30 hours but for 30 days. Anyway, none of this prevented Czech supporters
      of the MAGA movement from praising to the skies Donald Trump for the fact that
      the Easter truce is surely the result of his great diplomatic work. Consumers
      of disinformation, in short, live in a complete parallel reality that has very
      little to do with the actual reality. And yet [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid034PFXHWKdo2QCrEMJHFEx1sjUGQDg74fPsNEybQYabBfhhBnVKLP3JFqdUZ3Jx5Bml)
      happened:

      '
    detail: '- The American station FOX News aired a report during Easter in which
      it presented some traditions and customs from around the world. Among other
      things, it featured the Russian Patriarch Kirill and a live broadcast of the
      service with the headline "Kiev, Russia". The Ukrainian ministry is demanding
      an apology from the station, but also suspects that it was not a mistake, but
      an expression of a political position.

      - In another staged trial, the Russians sent five men behind bars for up to
      16 years after kidnapping them from Melitopol to Russia in the first year of
      the invasion to await trial. According to the indictment, for example, they
      were supposed to have been transporting explosives in a car - not running -
      in their backyard, and the key prosecution witnesses were every last one of
      them Russian citizens who had never seen any of the five Ukrainians.

      - The Orbán government is openly urging people to vote ''no'' in the future
      referendum on Ukraine''s admission to the EU and is scaring them with various
      black scenarios that will otherwise occur. Hungarians have also received official
      letters from the government claiming that the admission of Ukraine will cost
      the average Hungarian family hundreds of thousands of forints a year.

      - The price of diesel at Czech petrol stations has fallen below CZK 30 per litre.
      In terms of the median wage, we now have the cheapest diesel ever in the EU.
      Pro-Russian disinformation channels therefore began to spread disinformation
      about the alleged extremely expensive gas - supposedly because we do not take
      gas from Russia.

      - Lavrov said on Russian state television that European statesmen who do not
      want to come to Moscow for the military parade are "incomprehensibly openly
      taking steps to revive the ideas of Nazism".

      - The Independent claims that US billionaires who have invested in mining operations
      in Greenland have donated a total of USD 243 million to Donald Trump''s campaign.

      - British fighter jets have had to take off twice in the last week to confront
      Russian jets threatening NATO airspace.

      - Partisans in Crimea report that panic is spreading among Russian officers
      and some have begun evacuating their families from the island.

      - Ukraine''s Kraken special forces are now recruiting citizens of other countries
      into their ranks.

      - The Anonymous group has released 10 TB of data on Russian business activities
      in the West.

      - In yesterday''s prisoner exchange, 277 Ukrainian defenders returned home.

      Ukrainian provocations. Russia is preparing provocations that it will blame

      over Ukraine. Interestingly, the supposed "ceasefire" comes at a time when Trump
      has announced that if either side obstructs peace efforts, the United States
      will abandon it. Is the Trump administration coordinating its actions with the
      Russians? Even given the current U.S. stance on issues of Ukraine''s territorial
      integrity, it appears so. The greatest proof of this is the very fact that the
      United States has bought into the propagandistic interpretation of the Russian
      invasion of Ukraine, presenting it as a ''territorial dispute'' in line with
      the Russian narrative. This is not a territorial dispute. Russia has simply
      invaded a neighbouring country and is now pretending that the occupied territories
      are its own. It has no claim to them, as the vast majority of states at the

      \ to have an alibi for his servility and partisanship towards Russia.\n- Nearly\
      \ 100 Russian soldiers tore down a fence and fled a military base near Krasnodar.\
      \ The authorities deployed dozens of police on the streets and most of the deserters\

      regions. He may get some, but not all." The reason is that "both countries have

      Ukraine''s unwillingness to give up territory." Witkoff says it is possible
      that Ukraine will not be very interested in the predominantly Russian-speaking
      regions anyway. To illustrate Witkoff''s cretinism, it is worth remembering
      that President Zelensky himself used Russian as his mother tongue before the
      war, and conversely, in the Kherson region, which Russia claims, less than a
      quarter of the population spoke Russian before the war. In general, then, because

    desc: 'According to a joint investigative report by Reuters and the Open Source
      Center, Russia would probably have lost its war with Ukraine long ago if it
      weren''t for North Korea. Indeed, Russia is now completely dependent on North
      Korean supplies of shells, missiles and other munitions and equipment. From
      September 2023 to March 2025, North Korea shipped 15,809 cargo containers of
      military material to Russia. Some Russian forces use North Korean artillery
      shells 75-100% of the time. North Korean shells then account for an average
      of 50% of all shells fired by the Russian military. But the North Koreans have
      also sent the Russians less than 150 ballistic missiles, 120 heavy self-propelled
      guns and 120 salvo rocket launchers. And we must not forget the North Korean
      soldiers, who at one point numbered as many as 14,000 in the Kursk Olbasti and
      contributed significantly to the Russian counter-offensive. Without this assistance,
      Russia would almost certainly have been unable to replenish resources, maintain
      the intensity of the fighting, destroy Ukrainian defensive positions and advance
      slowly. And it must be said that the trade-off is mutually beneficial. According
      to South Korean analysts, North Korea made about $20 billion from the Russian
      invasion of Ukraine. Don''t forget that and don''t be afraid to remind the pro-Russian
      lunatics what club they are in. But now [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid023AGDKFwvYmW8hR4KxcFBo8NADNnTrNo8HL5jeNBVEDdFmh5Dv6NTtC9aDgeajYhPl):

    detail: "- Fico announced that he will go to a military parade in Moscow on 9\
      \ May. At the same time, he criticised EU diplomatic chief Kaja Kallas' call\
      \ for European statesmen to avoid travelling to Russia. He described it as insulting.\
      \ He said that no one would forbid him to do anything because we are living\
      \ in 2025 and not 1939. The last comment in particular is somewhat ironic, because\
      \ while in 1939 Nazi Germany, in collaboration with the Soviet Union, started\
      \ the Second World War, in Russia the events of 1939-41 are being covered up\
      \ and actively suppressed, and the 'Great Patriotic War' only began when Hitler\
      \ betrayed his then ally Stalin and invaded the USSR.\n- In the new form of\
      \ the US-Ukraine mineral deal, the Trump administration has reduced the estimate\
      \ of the total value of aid provided from $300 billion to $100 billion. This\
      \ was reported by Bloomberg. The Ukrainian team announced that the agreement\
      \ is beginning to take real shape and that both sides plan to sign a memorandum\
      \ of understanding in the near future and then negotiate the final form of the\
      \ agreement.\n- The Danish TV 2 station reported that Denmark plans to send\
      \ unarmed soldiers to Ukraine to participate in joint exercises with Ukrainian\
      \ soldiers and gain experience from them on the modern battlefield. In response,\
      \ the Russians announced that they would consider Danish troops in Ukraine a\
      \ legitimate target and warned Denmark not to be drawn into the war.\n- Ukraine's\
      \ Center for Combating Disinformation reported that engineers had discovered\
      \ capsules with highly concentrated CS irritant in some Russian Shahed drones.\
      \ This is supposed to be a way to injure people trying to dispose of the debris\
      \ of downed drones after airstrikes.\n- Ukrainian drones hit the base of the\
      \ 112th Guards Rocket Artillery Brigade in the town of Shuya in Ivanovo region.\
      \ It is the second of the units responsible for the Russian undeclared airstrike\
      \ on Sumy. The base of the first one was hit by the Ukrainians yesterday.\n\
      - Today's Russian airstrike finally destroyed the Kherson ice arena, which has\
      \ been used in the past by humanitarian organisations as a distribution depot\
      \ for various aid and which the Russians have bombed several times in the past\
      \ for this reason.\n- Bounties for Russian contract soldiers in the Siberian\
      \ Yamal have fallen by 40%. Whereas previously Russians earned 3.1 million roubles\
      \ for signing up to the army, now it is only 1.9 million. The reason for this\
      \ is said to be increased interest from volunteers from neighbouring regions.\n\
      - During the Kremlin talks, the Russians reportedly urged the Americans to allow\
      \ them to buy transport planes from Boeing and pay for them with part of the\
      \ Russian Central Bank's frozen reserves.  \n- The Russians have violated the\
      \ ceasefire over energy infrastructure three times in the last 24 hours. Substations\
      \ and high-voltage lines near Kherson, Poltava and Mykolayiv have been hit.\n\
      - The Economist reports that the Pentagon has contacted one of its partner states\
      \ in recent weeks to ask it to stop supplying arms to Ukraine, but it has refused.\n\
      - Russia has sent four Russian journalists - three men and one woman - to prison\
      \ for 5.5 years for cooperating with the Anti-Corruption Foundation of the slain\
      \ Alexei Navalny.\n- Trump threatens China with 245% tariffs on its goods. In\
      \ response, China has cancelled all contracts for purchases of Boeing aircraft\
      \ and aircraft parts.\n- Ukraine's SBU breaks up a cell of agents recruited\
      \ by the Russians for bombings across Ukraine. Among those detained are five\
      \ minors.\n- According to Ukrainian intelligence, it is possible that North\
      \ Korean soldiers will participate in the planned Russian offensive towards\
      \ Sumy.\n- Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 57 of 97 Russian kamikaze\
      \ drones last night. Another 34 drones crashed.\n- Italy handed over 28 million\
      \ euros to Ukraine for the reconstruction of the energy sector.\n- Finland will\

    desc: 'In retaliation for the Sumy raid, the Ukrainians struck the site of one
      of the two Russian army rocket artillery brigades responsible for carrying out
      the attack. The 448th Brigade''s base was located in the village of Klyukva
      in the Kursk region, and according to the Russians, its location was something
      of an open secret. Russian channels also suggest that the strike was more than
      successful. On one of the channels there was a resigned statement that "it cannot
      be said that the brigade has completely ceased to exist, but the losses are
      great and could have been easily avoided." The Russian authorities had earlier
      announced that their air defense forces had shot down 109 Ukrainian kamikaze
      drones overnight. However, more than 150 drones targeted the Kursk region, according
      to Russian bloggers. At least 31 of them were then expected to hit their intended
      target. And against that backdrop, [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid05KkEC7Q2qRhE65UGzvhW8wF7uYp1v6utZ1KzCtkyHx6SNGgRf9xUGEf5pR5BtH5el)
      happened:

      '
    detail: '- Trump refused to sell Ukraine 10 more Patriot systems for about $15
      billion. Sell, not donate or provide in the form of a loan. And to rub salt
      in the wound, he told Zelensky that he "shouldn''t have started a war with someone
      20 times bigger and then hoped someone would give him missiles." Recall that
      the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in 2014, when Zelensky was not even president,
      and it was Russia that started the war, not Ukraine. This, by the way, is the
      position taken by 140 countries in the U.N., until recently including the U.S.

      - In an interview with Fox News, Steve Witkoff revealed some of the Russian
      demands for possible peace talks that he brought back from Moscow: control of
      the 5 occupied regions of Ukraine, a promise that Ukraine will not join NATO,
      security guarantees, and more. So the current US administration has negotiated
      nothing at all. On the contrary, it has given Russia the feeling that it can
      insist on its original outrageous demands.

      - Representatives of ANO and SPD, after not attending the parliamentary meeting
      on the security of the Czech Republic, did not even come to the meeting, the
      topic of which was curbing illegal migration. These parties do not want to solve
      similar problems. On the contrary, it is in their interest for the problem to
      exist and to be as big as possible, because they benefit from it politically.

      - At the conference, Dugin said that Russia is fighting in Ukraine not only
      for itself, but also "for all the Chinese, Indians, Africans, Muslims and Latinos
      who are gaining new opportunities thanks to the war". Russia, he said, is fighting
      for "a new and just world order based on traditional values".

      - One of the authors of Project 2025, which serves as a manual for Trump''s
      ongoing coup d''état, Joel Webbon, wrote on Twitter that "young men are finally
      waking up and women will have to learn to be quiet and still or else they will
      be left alone."

      - The Russians are reportedly planning to build an air base in Papua New Guinea.
      It would be the first ever Russian base in the Pacific, and close to bases in
      the United States and Australia. The Australian Prime Minister has contacted
      the Indonesian authorities to confirm the information.

      - Zelensky dismissed the governor of the Sumy region after it emerged that there
      had indeed been an award ceremony at the Sumy Convention Centre, which the governor
      said he had not organised but knew about.

      - The Russian channel RIA Novosti published a report in which it showed viewers
      the work of Russian attack drone pilots. The report shows a group of Russian
      drone pilots working from one of the towers right in the centre of Moscow.

      - The United States has informed the G7 that it will not support a joint statement
      condemning Russian airstrikes on civilians because it does not want to upset
      Russia during the ongoing ceasefire talks.

      - A veteran of Donbas and Mariupol, the current commander of the 12th Special
      Forces of the Azov Brigade, Denys Prokopenko, will lead the newly formed 1st
      Azov Corps of the Ukrainian National Guard.

      - A Russian court sent Russian soldier Roman Ivashin to a maximum security prison
      for 15 years for surrendering to Ukrainian forces.

      - The United States repatriated the remains of volunteer Corey Nawrocki, who
      was killed in Bryansk region last October.

      - In a crazy stream of thought on Truth Social, Trump once again referred to
      the Russian invasion of Ukraine as "Biden''s war."

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 26 of 52 Russian kamikaze drones last
      night. Another 19 drones crashed.

      - Zelensky met with NATO Secretary General Rutt in Odessa.

      - The Russians are again trying to revive the front in Vovchansk.

    desc: 'Zelensky was interviewed by CBS on its "60 Minutes" program. After the
      station aired the interview, Trump posted a psychological rant on Truth Social
      in which he accused the network of bias, announced that he would sue the network
      and have its broadcasting licence revoked. He then indirectly instructed the
      current head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Carr, to assess
      maximum fines and penalties against the station for its alleged illegal conduct.
      He also lied again in the text about the 2020 election being rigged and called
      the CBS station complicit. In short, a "stable genius". And we''ll [stay with

      Sumi: "I think it''s terrible, and I''ve been told they (the Russians) made
      a mistake. But I think it''s a terrible thing. I think the whole war is a terrible
      thing. I think the war... to start the war... it''s an abuse of power. Our country
      would not have allowed that war to start in the first place if I were president."

      - For now, the latest update on the death toll from the Russian airstrike on
      Sumy says 34 dead and 117 wounded. Among the dead are two medical students at
      Sumy University and a musician from the local philharmonic orchestra.

      - According to Zelensky, the US information space is now completely dominated
      by Russian disinformation, which is living proof of the enormous influence of
      Russian psychology on US politics and its leaders.

      - Lavrov said that NATO should have been disbanded because - like the OSCE -
      it had failed to prevent conflicts in Europe. It''s not a joke, he really said
      it.

      - Zelensky''s Twitter/X account has personally thanked all the world leaders
      in the last 24 hours who have expressed their condolences to the victims of
      the Russian airstrike on Sumy.

      - According to Zelensky, Russian airstrikes on Ukrainian cities have already
      claimed the lives of more than 13,000 civilians, including 618 children, since
      the invasion began.

      - Estonia''s president has passed a law allowing the navy to use lethal force
      against civilian vessels suspected of sabotage.

      - A Russian drone hit a passenger train in Chernihiv. Fortunately, with tens
      of minutes to go, the train was mostly empty.

      - According to the Ukrainians, the missile strike on Sumy was carried out by
      the Russian 112th and 448th Rocket Artillery Brigades.

      - Future German Chancellor Merz is willing to provide Ukraine with Taurus missiles,
      including for strikes on Crimea.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 40 of 62 Russian kamikaze drones last
      night. 11 more drones crashed.

      - Poland''s foreign minister says Russia''s airstrikes make a mockery of US
      ceasefire efforts.

      - France has called on the EU to impose new sanctions on Russia in response
      to the strike on Sumy.

      - A giant warehouse complex on the outskirts of St. Petersburg is on fire.

    desc: 'The biggest event of the last 24 hours is undoubtedly the Russian airstrike
      on Sumy using two ballistic missiles, which, according to the latest update,
      has already left at least 34 dead and over 80 injured. The Russians claim that
      the target was the Sumy University Congress Centre, where awards were to be
      presented to members of the Territorial Defence, which is also suggested by
      some Ukrainian sources. There is no mention of such an event anywhere on the
      centre''s website or other channels; on the contrary, about half an hour after
      the missiles arrived, at 11:00, a theatre performance for children was due to
      start in one of the halls. In any case, one of the rockets hit the entrance
      to the convention centre, while the other landed in front of it on a busy street
      where dozens of people were walking and a public transport trolley was passing
      at the time of the attack. Which the Russians must have counted on, whatever
      their target. It is also worth remembering that even if there were indeed some
      soldiers (or militia members) present in the centre, since Russian aggression
      is contrary to international law, there is no such thing as a ''legitimate target''
      for the Russians on Ukrainian territory. Any attack on targets on Ukrainian
      territory is as illegal as the entire Russian invasion. Attacking the historic
      centre of a bustling city the size of Ostrava at its busiest time, on a major
      religious day, and with a missile that has a potential deflection of tens of
      metres from its target, then, is sheer cynicism of which perhaps only Russia
      is capable. But now for more [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02q9iVJrDzkXsLfeqZ9p86EoPhEeFKTfFpMXeS2puDj6AT5aeiqXkL8qVzmiwLMf2l):

    detail: "- The Russian ambassador to Britain did not deny in a television interview\
      \ that Russia had installed underwater sensors off the coast of Britain to track\
      \ the movements of NATO submarines. Instead, he claimed that any threat to Britain\
      \ was fictitious and that Russia posed no danger to Britain. This contrasts\
      \ sharply with the speeches of the Russian regime's propagandists, who have\
      \ a sadistic penchant for showing Russian audiences simulations of nuclear strikes\
      \ on Britain on an almost weekly basis, calling for the British Isles to be\
      \ wiped off the map and boasting about how their underwater nuclear weapon 'Poseidon'\
      \ will wash Britain away like a flood.\n- According to new information, one\
      \ of Ukraine's F-16s was shot down yesterday, not by its own air defences, but\
      \ by those of Russia. The machine was reportedly operating in a location where\
      \ no Ukrainian air defence systems were present. The Russians were to fire a\
      \ total of three missiles at it, presumably from the newer S-400 system. The\
      \ pilot managed to escape one of the missiles. But the second or third hit the\
      \ fighter.\n- The Russians are attempting to launch their long-announced spring\
      \ offensive in the Donetsk region. But Ukraine's 3rd Assault Brigade has launched\
      \ a strong counterattack to destroy the Russian bridgehead behind the Zherebets\
      \ River, which is the only place at the moment through which the Russians can\
      \ pour the 30,000 or so troops they have massed for the offensive onto the front.\n\
      - Lavrov is once again reviving the Russian fairy tale of NATO's supposed promise\
      \ not to expand eastward. He has now claimed that the promise was never implemented\
      \ in the form of a written agreement because \"Russia has a tradition of making\
      \ agreements verbally.\"\n- Trump reportedly demands in a new deal on Ukraine's\
      \ mineral wealth that Ukraine cede control of the Ukrainian portion of the Gazprom\
      \ pipeline to the United States.\n- The White House has released a report on\
      \ Donald Trump's physical condition. According to the doctor, Trump is - how\
      \ else but - in perfect shape, despite his 102 kilos.\n- Turkey plans to hold\
      \ a meeting on the safety of navigation in the Black Sea. Representatives of\
      \ Russia, Ukraine and other countries are invited.  \n- In Orenburg, Russia,\
      \ one of the substations there exploded near a Lukoil refinery.\n- Donald Trump\
      \ unveiled a statue of himself at his golf club in Mar-a-Lago called \"Monument\
      \ to Disobedience\".\n- Russians dropped a grenade from a drone on an 86-year-old\
      \ woman in downtown Kherson. She succumbed to her injuries on the spot.\n- The\
      \ Ukrainian Air Defense Forces shot down 43 out of 55 Russian kamikaze drones\
      \ overnight. Another 12 drones crashed.\n- Trump extended existing anti-Russian\
      \ sanctions for another year, according to a report on the government website.\n\
      - According to Budanov, about 40% of Ukraine's military arsenal is now domestically\
      \ produced.\n- Locals report several explosions at the Russian military airport\
      \ in Saratov.\n- One of the local kindergartens was hit by Russian shelling\
      \ of Kharkiv.\n"

    title: Saturday
    year: 12 April 2025
    desc: 'The 27th meeting of the Ramstein Contact Group is held in Brussels. The
      result is likely to be a record amount of military aid to Ukraine. What did
      the member countries pledge? Germany: 4 IRIS-T air defence systems with 300
      missiles, 30 missiles for Patriot systems, 15 Leopard-1 tanks, 25 Marder IFVs
      and 100,000 pieces of artillery ammunition worth around €11 billion in total.
      UK: hundreds of thousands of drones, radars and repair of damaged equipment,
      worth around £450 million in total. Norway: £100 million to co-finance the UK
      package + €1 billion for air defence and munitions. Norway will also reportedly
      allocate €822 million to train and equip the new Ukrainian "Scandinavian-Baltic"
      brigade. Belgium: a package totalling around EUR 1 billion. Denmark: the 25th
      aid package totalling EUR 900 million. Lithuania: EUR 20 million for various
      munitions. Estonia: 10 000 artillery shells and field rations for Ukrainian
      soldiers. The Netherlands: EUR 150 million to strengthen Ukraine''s air defence.
      Most of the aid has already been announced (often unofficially) before the meeting.
      But the summit did bring one complete novelty. A new coalition for electronic
      warfare was formed, led by Germany. This means primarily funding, combat deployment
      and further development of new Russian radio jammers, drones, guided missiles
      and other key electronic systems with which the modern battlefield is saturated.
      And then [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0gQsh1tKoeJFMhwca9S6EMhrKjg1XdayEnYVUxk6Nh8nbZeXdyERUupx7a58TDAWNl)
      happened:

      '
    detail: '- According to Trump''s attaché Kellogg, Ukraine in the peace talks "could
      be split in half almost like Berlin after World War II". He subsequently quipped
      that journalists had twisted his words. He was said to have been talking about
      who should be responsible for overseeing the ceasefire in different parts of
      Ukraine while preserving its territorial integrity.

      - Citing sources among U.S. officials, Reuters reports that Chinese officers
      regularly visited the Russian rear to shadow their Russian counterparts and
      gain experience in conducting real combat operations, with the knowledge of
      the Chinese Communist Party, which rated the officers'' trips as desirable.

      - Under unspecified circumstances, one of Ukraine''s F-16 fighter jets crashed
      today. Its pilot, 26-year-old Pavlo Ivanov, did not survive the incident. This
      is the second F-16 that Ukraine has lost. There is speculation on Ukrainian
      channels that the fighter was shot down by its own air defence forces.

      - According to Reuterts, Witkoff was to tell Trump after his meeting with Putin
      that the quickest way to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine was to cede to Russia
      four partially occupied Ukrainian regions that Russia considers its own.

      - Estonia has detained the Kiwala tanker, which belongs to Russia''s shadow
      fleet. It was sailing under the flag of Djibouti to the Russian port of Ust-Luga.
      However, Djibouti has announced that it has no such ship on its registers.

      - The Ukrainian delegation in the United States is discussing the form of a
      possible mineral agreement. Ukraine has hired lawyers from the US firm Hogan
      Lovells for this purpose.

      - Ukraine, in cooperation with Spain, commissioned a 0.8 MW solar power plant
      in the "zone" near the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

      - According to Polish President Duda, the President of the United States is
      the only person on the planet who has the power to ensure peace in Ukraine.

      - The Ukrainians claim that the Russians used FPV drones on one of the front
      lines against their own soldiers who tried to retreat.

      - Ukrainian air defense forces shot down 56 of 88 Russian kamikaze drones last
      night. 24 other drones crashed.

      - Ukraine will again extend martial law until at least 6 August.
