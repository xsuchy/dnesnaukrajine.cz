    desc: 'After the new defence minister nominated by the SPD, Jaromír Zůna, declared
      at a press conference that Russia is the aggressor and that the Czech munitions
      initiative will continue, the SPD has been showing us for days what their "freedom"
      and "democracy" mean. Okamura''s fascist party first tried to "set the record
      straight" with Zůna''s statements, then deleted Zůna''s social media accounts,
      and then videos of Zůna and SPD member Radim Fiala surfaced, with Fiala literally
      telling Zůna what views and positions to take. The SPD also announced as a precautionary
      measure that Zůna would only comment on military matters and that he would leave
      foreign policy to Prime Minister Babiš. Meanwhile, the SPD''s coalition partner,
      the Motorists, have begun purging the Foreign Ministry through Macinka and firing
      long-time career diplomats. And this is what''s happening too [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0pBwrpNGbP5FpHbkpu851JUPzGkHcrwHXhHRtnZYbXvKZScQGc2VUA8JJSTFHNQbwl):

    title: Tuesday
    detail: '- The Washington Post reports that the Russian economy is in danger.
      Russia''s reserves are depleted, sanctions are hitting oil and banks hard, and
      2026 could bring a financial crisis. The Kremlin has spent most of the cash
      reserves and borrowed money that allowed it to finance record military spending.
      But because of the sanctions, Moscow is forced to sell oil at a discount of
      more than $20 a barrel, and oil and gas revenues, which are crucial to the Russian
      budget, are falling. At the same time, military spending has reached a record
      $149 billion this year. Russian bankers themselves are sounding the alarm about
      the rising level of non-performing loans in the banking system. High interest
      rates, which have now fallen to 16%, may be taming high inflation slightly,
      but they are contributing to a parallel reduction in corporate profits and cash
      reserves. As a result, investment has stalled, production in some sectors has
      fallen sharply and insolvencies have increased throughout the economy.

      - Russia has sent 635 drones and 38 missiles/shots to Ukraine. At least 13 regions
      were hit and at least four people were killed, including a four-year-old child.
      In Kiev, the alert over the air strike lasted for almost four and a half hours
      and it was only over the morning that it was announced that the danger had passed.
      In the Svyatoshynskyi district of Kiev, a drone hit a high-rise apartment building.
      In the Kiev region, the debris of a drone landed on a residential building and
      destroyed it. The greatest damage was caused to the energy infrastructure in
      the west of Ukraine. As a result, most of Ukraine is experiencing emergency
      power cuts and the Rivne region is almost entirely without electricity.

      - Russia is refusing to leave the consulate in Gdansk, which must be closed
      by midnight on the 23rd, following a decision by the Ministry of the Interior.
      If it goes to court, the eviction of the Russians could take years. Meanwhile,
      Moscow has not paid a single penny for the building since 2013, bringing the
      debt for unpaid fees and interest to nearly €2 million. The court has already
      ordered Russia to pay about €80,000 in interest on the late fees. But Russia
      ignored it. It is strikingly reminiscent of the situation in Prague.

      - Russian state propaganda has produced a new video in which actors playing
      Europeans at Christmas dinner blame everything bad that happens in their lives
      on Putin. For context, it should be added that ''Putin is to blame for everything''
      is not only the point of current Russian propaganda, but also a long-standing
      argument of the local fifth column, which has been consuming Russian propaganda
      for years.

      - The Venezuelan army has started handing out rifles to civilians in working-class
      neighbourhoods. Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry has begun evacuating
      the families of diplomats from Venezuela. What are the chances that Trump traded
      the Russians'' departure from Venezuela for the US not intervening in Ukraine?

      - Babis announced that the Czech Security Council will decide on the future
      of the munitions initiative on January 7. In his words, it is a good thing,
      but it needs to be investigated to see if there was corruption involved.

      - According to the Financial Times, Putin has been receiving overly optimistic
      reports from the battlefield, leading him to believe that Russia is winning
      the war, when the reality is much more complicated.

      - The US is again increasing pressure on Greenland. Donald Trump''s special
      envoy for Greenland, Jeff Landry, has said that the island should become part
      of the United States.

      - The United States has banned all new foreign-made drones and related components
      on the grounds that they pose a risk of espionage and data leaks.

      - Without explanation, the United States has lifted sanctions on several companies
      previously accused of supporting the Russian military.

      - Over 1.19 million Russian soldiers have already died or suffered irreversible
      injuries in Ukraine, yet the Kremlin has not yet captured a single major city.

      - According to a recent Pentagon preliminary report, China expects to be able
      to wage and win a war over Taiwan by the end of 2027.

      - Finnish President Alexander Stubb signed a law raising the age for enlistment
      from 50 to 65 for all eligible draftees.

      - About 100 Russian soldiers remain in Kupjansk with almost no ammunition and
      no supplies reaching them.

      - Putin recalled Ambassador Alexander Zmeyevsky and replaced him with Anna Ponomareva.

      - Aidar officially announced that he was expanding to a regiment.

    desc: 'Since November 2023, Belarus has been implementing a classified state project
      to build an ammunition plant and create a complete production cycle for 122mm
      and 152mm artillery and rocket ammunition for the Russian army in Ukraine. Thus,
      Belarus continues to play the role of Russia''s forward base as well as its
      "bank", willingly providing whatever Putin asks for. That is why the steps taken
      by the current US administration to loosen some of the sanctions against Belarus
      in recent months are incredible. To allow Belarus to get its economy back on
      its feet now is to indirectly finance Russia''s invasion of Ukraine. And that''s
      what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02F2eSmxjURz5cdEpArHAyHjdVL4ywpEi4EzcM2esx1wRxw6imZGh44K5WXkr4JePgl):

    title: Monday
    detail: '- Sweden has detained the Russian cargo ship Adler, whose owner is subject
      to EU and US sanctions and is accused of transporting weapons used in the war
      against Ukraine. The ship was detained in Swedish territorial waters for not
      having a mandatory customs declaration. However, it was later released again
      by the Swedish coastguard without any charges being brought.

      - The head of the Russian Armed Forces'' Operational Training Department, Lieutenant
      General Sarvarov, was killed in a car explosion in Moscow. The explosion occurred
      when Sarvarov slammed on the brakes. As a result of the explosion, he suffered
      severe multiple injuries to his lower limbs from shrapnel and later died in
      hospital.

      - Video from the Ukrainian 92nd Brigade shows two Russian soldiers moving into
      position on horseback. One of them was probably killed by an FPV drone along
      with the animal, the other was thrown by the horse and escaped.

      - The head of a Ukrainian arms company, Anatoly Khrapchynsky, warned that Russia
      was producing about 20% more weapons, equipment and ammunition than it needed
      for the war with Ukraine. He says he is stockpiling supplies for potential operations
      in Europe.

      - The Serbian news server "Danas", citing Russian sources, reports that Serbian
      and Armenian banks have begun blocking financial transactions and even the bank
      accounts of Russian citizens living in the two countries.

      - Boris Titov, Putin''s special representative for relations with international
      organisations in the field of sustainable development, said that at least 40
      000 migrants from India may come to Russia for work next year.

      - Lithuania has supplied Ukraine with a thermal power plant. The operation lasted
      11 months and included 149 deliveries of technical equipment to enable emergency
      repairs to Ukraine''s energy infrastructure.

      - Intelligence services in NATO countries suspect Russia of working on a weapon
      that could disable entire constellations of satellites at once using clouds
      of tiny fragments in orbit.

      - In November 2025, China bought a record $961 million worth of gold from Russia,
      the largest single transaction in the precious metal in history.

      - In January 2026, NATO will open a second major military assistance centre
      on Romanian territory, creating a southern supply corridor to complement the
      existing Polish route via Rzeszów.

      - A working group is being set up in the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada to urgently
      address the issue of holding possible presidential elections under martial law.

      - Russian troops crossed the border in the Sumy region, entered the border village
      of Hraboske and took about fifty local residents back to Russia.

      - Ukrainian drones hit the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal in the village of Volna
      in the Krasnodar region. Two Russian oil tankers were also hit in the attack.

      - The Russian oil tanker Valery Gorchakov, which was hit by a drone near the
      Novoshakhtinsk oil terminal on 18 December, continues to sink.

    desc: 'The Wall Street Journal claims that Putin himself chose Witkoff as his
      chief negotiator with the US. The Russian-US talks began after the Saudi prince
      gave Witkoff a message from the Kremlin: Putin is interested in meeting with
      him. But the Kremlin had a condition at the time: Witkoff must come alone, without
      CIA agents, diplomats, or even his own translator. During the first meeting,
      Putin was then to offer Witkoff the release of American Mark Fogel, sentenced
      in Russia to several years in prison for possession of a small amount of cannabis
      (Fogel was presumably detained precisely to serve as a hostage, and was indeed
      released after the negotiations). That Putin chose Witkoff in particular was
      no accident: Putin had studied psychological profiles of people in Trump''s
      inner circle, including the special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, but whom
      the Russian dictator considered too pro-Ukrainian. With Witkoff, he was clearly
      on target. Anyway, other [things] happened too(https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0TL1LRJeCTRDaeTQ4MwtAYvFXmH8bjKMqZmFC8i96XAKKHfZ5Gh3oyHVN5ruFH4PQl):

    title: Sunday
    detail: '- According to DeepState, the Russians again attempted to use the pipeline
      for infiltration and suffered heavy losses in the process. The attack took place
      on December 16 north of Novoplatonivka. Russian troops attempted to move through
      the pipeline leading from Svatovo to the Oskil River. However, the 77th Independent
      Air Brigade noticed that groups of Russians were coming out of the pipeline
      at several points and attacked them with bombing drones. As a result, 40 Russian
      soldiers were destroyed in their sector and all losses were documented on video.

      - A central gas pipeline in Russia''s Volgograd region was taken out of service
      on Thursday, indefinitely disrupting a route Russia uses to import up to 12
      billion cubic meters of gas a year from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Ukrainian
      military intelligence suggests that this is a consequence of its actions.

      - Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of the Ukrainian armed forces, was awarded
      France''s highest state decoration, the Legion of Honour, which is bestowed
      by the head of state for exceptional military or civilian merit.

      - Orbán: "Of course, Russia has been attacked in the past - by Napoleon, for
      example, right? And Hitler. (sarcastically) But now, of course, Kaja Kallas
      will ''succeed'' - that''s understood."

      - Ukraine''s Foreign Ministry is working to create a mechanism to allow Ukrainian
      citizens living abroad to vote in the next Ukrainian elections.

      - Russian collaborators flew a small drone carrying the Russian flag over Kiev
      for several minutes yesterday before security forces shot it down using electronic
      warfare systems.

      - Russia is turning the occupied Donbas into a base for recruiting soldiers
      and using financial debts to force Ukrainians into contracts with the military.

      - Kremlin official Kirill Dmitriev said after a meeting in the United States
      that Russia is preparing to cooperate with the United States in the Arctic.

      - Portugal will contribute $52 million to the PURL mechanism, which allows Ukraine
      to buy weapons from the United States.

      - Ukraine replaces the commanding officer of the Southern Air Force Command
      after repeated deadly Russian airstrikes in the Odessa region.

      - According to Ukrainian war veteran Mykola Melnyk, the battle for Slovyansk
      will begin as early as next year and is "inevitable."

      - The United States intercepts another tanker carrying a cargo of Venezuelan
      oil - this time belonging to a Chinese company.

      - Polish and Ukrainian representatives met in the town of Uhly to prepare for
      the exhumation of the victims of the Volyn tragedy.

      - Ukraine and Portugal signed an agreement on cooperation in the production
      of maritime drones.

      First, kamikaze Shahed drones and then a ballistic missile hit the bridge. The
      missile carried cluster munitions, which are designed to destroy live forces,
      while they cannot seriously damage the bridge. The Russians therefore used the
      missile to try to kill either civilians or the intervening security forces.

    desc: 'Putin has openly declared that the goal of the Russian invasion of Ukraine
      is to "liberate Russia''s historical territories". In doing so, he has de facto
      confirmed that all previous "reasons", such as the expansion of NATO, the alleged
      fascists in charge of Ukraine, or the alleged oppression of the Russian-speaking
      minority, are just lying propaganda to cover up the real reason for Russian
      aggression: imperialism. The smarter ones have known this for the last thirty
      years. Perhaps Putin''s admission will finally open the eyes of some. But the
      members of Russia''s fifth column will continue to parrot every lie that portrays
      Russia as a victim so that they don''t have to admit that they are nasty people
      cheering on a nasty regime. And that''s what''s happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02CVEe2fpkmSJrETF7iY8ZXjdywcjLWaozy8uyD73ut8VqTXsyShArvRgr9iSJTQnl):

    title: Friday
    detail: "- The following information appeared on Ukrainian and many Russian channels:\
      \ the Ukrainian army hit a tanker belonging to the Russian shadow fleet in the\
      \ Mediterranean Sea. However, the oil on board was allegedly not oil, but persons\
      \ with links to the Russian government and members of the military intelligence\
      \ (GRU) responsible for drone spying across Europe, sabotage and other subversive\
      \ actions. Seven people were reportedly injured and two killed in the attack.\
      \ One of the two dead is believed to be Andrei Vladimirovich Averyanov, at the\
      \ time a GRU Major General. Averjanov was responsible for GRU activities primarily\
      \ on EU territory, but not only there. On Putin's orders, he had carried out\
      \ a number of operations abroad in recent years. He was also supposed to have\
      \ been involved in the bombing of Prigozhin's plane or the Novichok poisoning\
      \ in Britain. But pending confirmation from official sources, the report should\
      \ be taken with a grain of salt.\n- According to the intelligence services and\
      \ militaries of several European countries, it is increasingly common for military\
      \ personnel or members of private armies, such as the Wagner family, to be present\
      \ on ships belonging to the Russian shadow fleet. In addition, it is reportedly\
      \ apparent that armed personnel are on board not only to defend the ship, but\
      \ in fact control the ship. Therefore, it is believed that the tankers both\
      \ serve a reconnaissance function and also serve as floating bases for subversive\
      \ actions. This correlates with the previous report.  \n- Russia lured two Colombians\
      \ to work as welders for $2,500 a month. But in Ufa, their passports were confiscated\
      \ and the pair were given rifles instead of welders. Three of the original seven\
      \ members of the hit squad they were assigned to are now dead. These two survived\
      \ and surrendered without firing a single shot.\n- Russia has been trying for\
      \ days to cut off the western part of the Odessa region from the rest of it.\
      \ Russian Geran drones have repeatedly attacked bridges there in large swarms.\
      \ On 18 December, one such drone hit a civilian car travelling on a bridge,\
      \ killing the woman driver and injuring her three children.\n- Ukrainian intelligence\
      \ has used drones to hit another Russian oil platform in the Caspian Sea. This\
      \ is the fourth attack and the third oil platform hit. The last attack was against\
      \ a platform in the Rakushchenskoye area, named after Valery Graifer.\n- Pavel\
      \ Gubarev, the former occupation chief of Donetsk, claims that Chechen Kadyrov's\
      \ forces from the Akhmat militia did not fight in the occupied territories of\
      \ Ukraine, but only looted.\n- The new SPD-nominated defence minister announced\
      \ that the munitions initiative for Ukraine would continue and praised the outgoing\
      \ government for its project to buy F-35 fighter jets.\n- The European Parliament\
      \ voted in favour of the creation of a \"military Schengen\", which will allow\
      \ troops to cross borders within 24 hours in the event of a crisis.\n- The US\
      \ Treasury lifted sanctions on entities that supply components and technology\
      \ to the Russian and Iranian military industries.\n- In Switzerland, a court\
      \ found guilty a citizen who had participated in the fighting as a volunteer\
      \ soldier in the ranks of Ukraine.  \n- Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia\
      \ will not join the EU-wide funding of Ukraine.\n- Russia has begun to claim\
      \ that \"Old Finland\" (Vanha Suomi) is territory that belongs to Russia.\n\
      - According to Putin, some 700,000 Russian troops are now fighting on Ukrainian\
      \ territory.\n- Putin said on television that Ukraine had started the war with\
      \ Russia.\n- Ukraine has repatriated the remains of another 1,000 fallen soldiers.\n\
      - The crew of a Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter was killed in combat.\n- A stray\
      \ Russian Orlan drone crashed into Turkish territory.\n"

    desc: 'Ukrainian drones hit the Russian military airport Belbek in occupied Crimea.
      The airstrike destroyed a Russian MiG-31 fighter-bomber, which was fully armed
      with missiles at the time of the attack. The Pantsir-S2 air defence system,
      which was supposed to protect the airport from the drones, was also destroyed,
      as was the 92N6 radar belonging to the S-400 system and two other Nebo-SVU radars.
      These attacks are important not only because they weaken the Russian army, but
      also because they weaken the Russian military industry. Russia profits from
      its massive arms exports, especially to Africa, Asia and some countries in South
      America. And if its clients see on the ground that the systems are not working
      as they should on paper, countries will start looking for other suppliers. However,
      this is also happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02LH1g3PLkmE74Rj7JLN6R3bdrv7PBdPxBunt8sBv8jm6WkDPkikKQU4C6WpSc4eHul).

    title: Thursday
    detail: '- The US announced a massive military package for Taiwan, the largest
      ever. The package, worth over $11 billion, is to include: The US Armed Forces
      Tactical Operations Network (TMN), 82 HIMARS missile systems, 420 ATACMS tactical
      missile systems, 120 M109A7 Paladin self-propelled howitzers, 1,545 TOW missiles,
      1,050 Javelin anti-tank missiles, parts for Harpoon anti-ship missiles, ALTIUS-600M
      and 700M drones, and spare parts for AH-1W SuperCobra attack helicopters.

      - On the Zaporizhzhya front, a cynical system of corruption operates within
      the Russian military. A group of soldiers pays their commander 50,000 rubles
      in cash every month to avoid the front. In return, they work in the army headquarters,
      where they are assigned fictitious "internal tasks" while official documents
      label them as combat mission participants in order to keep their higher pay
      and benefits.

      - On Wednesday morning, a trio of Russian border guards crossed the border with
      Estonia and were on Estonian territory for about 20 minutes. The Estonian authorities
      claim in official communications that this may have been a provocation, but
      it is equally possible that it was a mistake; however, given that it is impossible
      for the Russian border guards not to know which way the common border runs,
      it can be assumed that it was a provocation.

      - According to the Guardian, Russian military intelligence is conducting an
      intimidation campaign in which it is threatening Belgian officials. The aim
      is to prevent the transfer of frozen Russian currency reserves to Ukraine. At
      the same time, there are reports that the Americans are also discouraging European
      leaders from seizing Russian assets.

      - In a speech yesterday, Putin described European leaders as "underdogs". Today,
      Russian state propaganda ''explains'' that this is because they are the descendants
      of European Nazis with ''imperialist ambitions'' who are redrawing maps and
      dreaming of revenge for the Second World War. In short, classic Russian psychological
      projection.

      - The US Senate has approved a defence budget for fiscal year 2026 of more than
      900 billion dollars. The bill also includes $400 million for Ukraine as part
      of a programme to buy new weapons.

      - Erdoğan is offering Russia back its S-400 missile systems, reportedly unused
      as Turkey seeks to restore relations with the US and a potential purchase of
      F-35 fighter jets, which has been halted due to the acquisition of the air defense
      systems.

      - Trump justifies possible military intervention in Venezuela on the grounds
      that US companies until recently had licenses to extract Venezuelan oil, and
      that he thus wants to "take back what belongs to the United States".

      - According to Putin, "the objectives of the Special Military Operation must
      be fulfilled unconditionally". He also reiterated the need to occupy other Ukrainian
      territories and referred to Odessa as a "Russian city."

      - Tankers carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea have begun to take a detour
      along the coasts of Georgia and Turkey to reduce the risk of attacks by Ukrainian
      naval drones.

      - A fire broke out at the Ordzhonikidze plant in Saratov, Russia, a major industrial
      complex known for producing aerospace and defence equipment.

      - Britain is demanding that Abramovich hand over £2.5 billion from the sale
      of Chelsea to Ukraine. If he fails to do so, the funds will reportedly be obtained
      through the courts.

      - Russia sank several vessels at the entrance to the port of Novorossiysk, de
      facto barricading the Black Sea Fleet ships from the high seas.

      - According to TASS, Steve Witkoff handed Trump a crate of red caviar from Russia''s
      Khabarovsk region.

      - Ukraine hit an oil tanker in the port of Rostov, Russia, last night. Two crew
      members were killed and three others were injured.

      - The Russian army absorbed some territorial defence units in order to deploy
      them to the front.

      - Poland began production of anti-personnel mines for the first time since the
      end of the Cold War.

      - The EU approved a complete withdrawal from Russian gas by the end of 2027.

      - The Ukrainians regain control of about 90% of Kupyansk.

      convoy heading from the Pokrovsk region to the 3.5 km distant town of Hryshyn,
      believing that this would bypass the Ukrainian positions and cut off their supply
      routes. However, Ukrainian drones were constantly monitoring the area. Drone
      videos show that the entire convoy lay in ashes about a kilometre after take-off
      - several vehicles were hit simultaneously, suggesting that dozens of drones
      were waiting in advance in a convenient location for Russian vehicles to ambush.
      The final tally: 10 vehicles destroyed, around 40 soldiers killed. The surviving

    title: Wednesday
    detail: '- Investigators have released details of the recent brutal murder of
      21-year-old Danylo Kuzmin, the son of the deputy mayor of Kharkiv, in Vienna.
      Kuzmin was lured into a trap in the underground garage of the luxury Sofitel
      hotel by his 19-year-old compatriot and his 45-year-old accomplice. In the garage,
      he was brutally beaten so badly that Kuzmin had almost no teeth left. During
      the torture, Kuzmin revealed the passwords to two crypto wallets containing
      $200,000 in cryptocurrency. The badly injured Kuzmin was then placed in the
      back seat of a Mercedes belonging to his father and taken to the Donaustadt
      district of Vienna, where the perpetrators set the car on fire with Kuzmin still
      alive inside. On the basis of footage from hotel cameras, the Viennese police
      quickly identified the suspects. The 45-year-old suspect is a former high-ranking
      official of the Odessa customs administration, while the 19-year-old is the
      son of a well-known businessman from Chernivtsi and the stepson of the Ukrainian
      ambassador to Bulgaria.

      - Overnight, Ukrainian forces carried out a series of airstrikes, hitting, for
      example, an oil refinery near Slavyansk-on-Kuban. The plant processes up to
      5.2 million tonnes of oil a year and directly supports the Russian army. Drones
      have also damaged high voltage power lines there. In addition, an attack on
      the Nikolayevskaya fuel depot in the Rostov region has been confirmed. Tanks
      as well as the river barge Kapitan Gibert were damaged. In the occupied Luhansk
      region, a field artillery ammunition depot belonging to one of the units was
      destroyed.

      - German Chancellor Merz says the security guarantees proposed by the United
      States would allow Western forces to "intervene against Russian incursions and
      attacks" in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine. In any case, Russia has announced
      in advance that it will not accept the presence of any Western troops in Ukraine.

      - German MP and military expert Kiesewetter clarified that yesterday''s information
      about 360,000 Russian troops on NATO''s borders should not be seen as an assessment
      of the real presence of Russian troops in Belarus, but that it was "based on
      a misinterpretation of broader estimates of the size of the army."

      - The US President has branded the Maduro regime a foreign terrorist organisation
      and announced a "complete and total blockade" of oil tankers sailing to and
      from Venezuela. Under international law, this is potentially an act of war,
      which requires congressional approval.

      - Nigel Farage''s biggest backer, who has just given £9 million in financial
      support to Reform UK, is financially linked to a platform that spreads Russian
      state propaganda and runs influence operations linked to Russian intelligence.

      - Russian Defence Minister Belousov: ''NATO began preparations for a conflict
      with Russia in the early 1930s. The policy of European countries and NATO creates
      real preconditions for the continuation of military actions in Ukraine in 2026."

      - Legal guarantees have not been enough to allay Belgium''s fears of Russian
      retaliation, and Italy, Malta, Bulgaria and now the Czech Republic are supporting
      Belgium''s call for alternative ways to finance Ukraine''s reconstruction.

      - The European Union has added Diana Panchenko, a Russian propagandist of Ukrainian
      origin, to the sanctions list. The one that Rajchl claimed was an "independent,
      award-winning journalist with whom he is in contact".

      - Washington is preparing a new package of sanctions, including measures targeting
      Russia''s energy sector, to increase pressure on Moscow if Putin rejects the
      proposed peace deal.

      - Boris Pistorius announced that Germany will extend military aid to Ukraine
      for 2026 by another 3 billion euros. This will bring the total aid to 11.5 billion
      euros, a new record.

      - Ukrainian troops continue to advance in and around Kupyansk in the Kharkiv
      region, where the Russians must now rely on drones to supply isolated troops.

      - Georgia''s parliament, controlled by the pro-Russian Georgian Sen party, has
      passed a law to abolish the anti-corruption office, which was set up on the
      recommendation of the EU.

      - 34 countries and the European Union signed a convention to establish a new
      compensation body, the International Commission on Compensation for Ukraine.

      - Slovakia granted asylum to Russian influence operation actor Artyom Marchevsky,
      despite a promise to the Czech BIS.

      - Solovyov: "We will have to destroy godforsaken Berlin again, re-enter Paris
      and liberate Vienna on the way."

      SDPR in Russia, was assassinated in Moscow.

      - Ukrainian forces liquidated Mykhailo Mishyn, former "DNR Minister of Sport",
      near Pokrovsk.

      - Ukrainian drones hit and destroyed a column of Russian S-400 systems in Rajevka
      near Belgorod.

      - Putin signed a law allowing the seizure of real estate in occupied territories.

      - Russian propaganda is now spreading claims that Zelensky is the owner of an
      Israeli passport.

      - A Russian "guided" aerial bomb landed on a block of flats in Zaporozhye today.

      several pupils at a local school. Videos on the networks show that the attacker
      explicitly targeted immigrants. He was wearing a T-shirt with "No Lives Matter"
      written on it and before the attack he actively addressed the pupils and asked
      which of them was a foreigner. Police said the attacker was a supporter of neo-Nazi
      movements. This is the second attack on a Russian school in two days.

      - British Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, Chief of the General Staff, said
      the country must prepare for a possible war with Russia. He said the risk of
      an attack was real and needed to be openly communicated not only to the military
      but also to ordinary people - families and households. The situation, he said,
      is the most dangerous in his entire career in the army.

      - The Swedish Navy has announced that armed personnel in Russian military uniforms
      are on board tankers carrying Russian oil and subject to sanctions. According

      Gulf of Finland.

    desc: 'Kiev and the whole of eastern Ukraine are just one step away from a widespread
      power outage, analysts say. At risk are key elements of the power grid that
      bring electricity from western Ukraine - where most of the production is now
      concentrated - to the east. According to the WP, the Kremlin is deliberately
      creating so-called "energy islands" to completely cut off entire regions from
      electricity production and a unified grid. This makes no military sense, of
      course. It is a deliberate terrorising of the civilian population, a psychological
      operation to force Ukraine to surrender through political pressure. And it is
      having an effect not only on the Ukrainian civilian population, but also on
      civilians in Western countries, where, in response, there is a growing sentiment
      of ''as long as the suffering stops, no matter how''. The Ukrainians themselves
      are much more resilient than some Westerners think. And a new opinion poll in
      Ukraine proves it. But I''d get ahead of myself, first this [news](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0X9bE5sXDEzqC43wCCL1MtdRMg65NWGUEcDhwcFHDVsw3Cwx4hxQCZBRdsJphz5pCl):

      '
    detail: '- According to AFP, the US delegation in Berlin is pressing Ukraine to
      surrender Donbas. The current proposal includes a "freeze" of the front, under
      which Ukraine would have to relinquish control of part of its territory. In
      Kiev, in any case, this proposal is not seen as a path to peace, but as a forced
      surrender.

      - Fascism in the world is on the rise. The ultra-conservative politician José
      Antonio Kast has been elected President of Chile. Kast is the son of a former
      Nazi Party member who moved to Chile after World War II and is an unapologetic
      admirer of dictator Augusto Pinochet.

      - Russia has begun recruiting mercenaries in Iran, offering a signing bonus
      of $20,000 and a monthly salary of $2,000 through Telegram. It is targeting
      economically vulnerable populations in a campaign that has already attracted
      18,000 foreigners from 128 countries.

      - According to the latest poll, 61% of Ukrainians support Zelensky as Ukraine''s
      leader. Fewer than a tenth of Ukrainians support holding elections during wartime.
      75% of Ukrainians oppose a "peace plan" if it includes territorial concessions.

      - German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told Die Welt that German authorities
      are investigating the recruitment of radical groups by foreign governments for
      sabotage and espionage.

      - "We don''t need any agreement, we don''t need any arrangement - we need the
      surrender of Ukraine."- Russian Ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin

      - Estonian President Alar Karis said Tallinn is ready to help Hungary pay fines
      if Budapest terminates its energy contracts with Russia.

      - Russia''s Yaroslavneftorgsintez refinery, which produces gasoline, diesel
      and aviation fuel, had to completely halt production after the Ukrainian strikes.

      - President Zelensky is proposing that Ukraine abandon its bid for NATO membership
      in exchange for firm security guarantees from the West.

      - Fugitive former Syrian President Bashar Assad has decided to start a new life
      in Russia - he has become an ophthalmologist and is treating Moscow''s elite.

      - The US envoy says Belarus will release another 1 000 political prisoners in
      the coming weeks.

    desc: 'Austria has uncovered a conspiracy network organised by the Russian FSB
      posing as "Ukrainian Nazis". The network was coordinated by a native Austrian
      who has long worked for the Russian intelligence services. From 2022, he and
      a colleague - a Bulgarian citizen who was later arrested in London - organised
      the production and pasting of stickers and spray-painting of graffiti with far-right
      and neo-Nazi symbols in public places. All these actions were aimed at giving
      the impression that neo-Nazi symbols were being spread by Ukrainians. In addition,
      the two men, in cooperation with others, created a network of websites that
      mimicked the European branches of the Ukrainian Azov regiment. According to
      the investigation, the psychological operation did not only concern Austria,
      but also other European countries. In short, there are so many Nazis in Ukraine
      that Russian intelligence has to constantly invent them. And that''s what''s
      happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0UxuYbYPYVZ712tqkV8xgFxwvUiWWw8eCrFbdejL8Ty2RCcFZKiQFmcsAg8V7GukDl):

    detail: '- Prisoners who were released during some of the exchanges for Russian
      soldiers described what is known in Russian prisons and prison camps as a "gentleman''s
      kit": suffocation with plastic bags, electric shocks to the genitals, breaking
      of fingers, needles under the fingernails, and forcible removal of any pro-Ukrainian
      tattoos.

      - Ukrainian media report that Siversk in the Donetsk region, which Russian troops
      have been actively attacking since the end of October under the cover of a thick
      fog, has been almost completely captured and its recapture will require the
      deployment of reserves, which are currently lacking in this area.

      - The Russian Volunteer Corps fighting on the side of Ukraine (RDK) has called
      on all civil and political opposition forces in Russia to unite on a single
      platform and use Russia''s exclusion from PACE to become a legitimate international
      alternative to the Kremlin.

      - Pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash, who is being prosecuted in
      the U.S. for FCPA violations, won a court case in Austria and will not be extradited
      to the U.S. because U.S. prosecutors failed to meet a deadline for filing an
      appeal.

      - Russia''s oil and gas revenues in December are estimated to be almost half
      of the previous year''s level, at around 410 billion rubles ($5.17 billion).

      - Polish border guards uncovered a tunnel dug from Belarus to Poland that was
      being used by smugglers to move goods and people. At least three perpetrators
      were detained by investigators.

      - Ukraine is now facing up to 300 Russian attacks a day, the most since the
      war began, as Russia attacks along virtually the entire front line.

      - Belarus released 123 political prisoners yesterday, just hours after the US
      agreed to lift sanctions on Belarusian potash.

      - Mass protests erupted in Hungary over videos showing violence against children
      in state-run orphanages.

      - Estonia has begun construction of the first concrete bunkers along its south-eastern
      border with Russia as part of the Baltic defence line.

      - The Russians launched another airstrike on Odessa this morning. Explosions
      rocked the city for at least six hours straight. Russia is a terrorist state.

      - The Ukrainians hit two Russian fuel depots overnight - one near Volgograd,
      the other in occupied Crimea.

      - A Russian An-22 military transport plane with seven people on board crashed
      in Russia''s Ivanovo region.

    desc: 'Igor Girkin published another letter from prison: ''Ukraine is basing its
      strategy on the exhaustion of Russia, for us it is a protracted and fruitless
      war that is still going on. Many try to forget that the war has been going on
      for almost four years. During this time, we have not only failed to liberate
      Novorossiya, but also to clear the Donbas of the enemy. In the fourth year of
      the war, the enemy began attacking economic and infrastructural targets deep
      in the rear of the Russian Federation, which also does not indicate that we
      are winning the war. Yes, there are frequent reports from the front that we
      have liberated another settlement, but overall the enemy maintains the integrity
      of the front and his army has not collapsed. Therefore, unfortunately, we cannot
      say that victory has already been achieved or that it is very close. Production
      is falling, inflation is rising and economic difficulties are deepening, which
      can no longer be compensated for by drawing on reserves, because these reserves
      are already depleted. The state can no longer continue to wage war as it has
      done for four years, i.e. without switching to a war economy. And this is what
      our so-called "friends" are waiting for: that after a certain period of time
      the Russian economy will enter a spiral of decline, causing a collapse both
      on the front and in the home front, and they will win the war by attrition."
      And in the meantime, [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid02YubFHUGMEDagE7T6UouFH1pUTJaCaNqBHZ1RzsCbgGi6KBqyT1RnLTfAsX6UAf17l)

      '
    detail: '- Russia is exploring ways to install radio frequency repeaters to guide
      Shahed drones on Ukrainian territory. It plans to use private properties and
      especially the elderly to do so. Therefore, the authorities warn people to alert
      their elderly parents and neighbours to pay extra attention to suspicious requests
      from unknown persons directed to install any boxes in the house or yard, which
      must be connected to an electrical outlet and, if possible, to the Internet.

      - Odessa is without electricity, water and heating after more than 300 Russian
      missiles and drones targeted civilian infrastructure there this morning. The
      outage has affected around 1 million people. Russia is thus systematically terrorising
      another city with a relatively large Russian-speaking population that the Russians
      falsely claim historically belongs to them. In total, Russia sent 465 drones
      and 30 missiles last night.

      - The Wall Street Journal reports that Russia''s advance in Ukraine has been
      slower than almost any major military operation of the past century. After nearly
      four years of war, Moscow still hasn''t conquered the Donetsk region, which
      has been its target since 2014.

      - Alexei Zhuravlyov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma''s defence committee,
      said in a Russian TV debate: "We have no choice but to keep fighting. We will
      stop in Kiev. All wars end in capitals."

      - Trump is going to bomb Venezuela - there will be ground strikes all over the
      country. Trump says the goal is to end the drug trade. But he also admits, none
      too covertly, that Venezuelan oil is the reason.

      - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has approved the participation of
      Russian and Belarusian youth athletes under their national flags in international
      junior events, including the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar.

      - Long-range drones manned by the SBU''s special Alpha unit again hit the Filanovsky
      oil rig in the Caspian Sea, but this time also the nearby Korchagin platform.

      - The US lifted sanctions on the Belaruskali production facility. Belaruskali
      is a large Belarusian state enterprise, one of the world''s largest producers
      and exporters of potash fertilizers.

      - The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was again without power overnight - for
      the twelfth time. The plant is believed to have lost all external power supplies.

      - Trump is reportedly prepared to provide Ukraine with NATO Article 5 style
      security guarantees in exchange for the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from
      the Donbas.

      - The commander of the Russian neo-Nazi battalion "Espaňola" with the call sign
      "Spaniard" (Czech: "Spaniard") was killed in fighting in Ukraine.

      - The US Congress has banned the Pentagon from unilaterally diverting weapons
      destined for Ukraine for other purposes.

    desc: 'The SBU says it has detained three suspected Russian agents in connection
      with yesterday''s bombing in Kiev that killed a National Guard member. The attack
      was carried out by three Ukrainians from the Odessa and Donetsk regions, aged
      23, 27 and 25. They all worked in construction and were recruited by the Russian
      FSB in an attempt to earn extra money through the Telegram app. Following instructions,
      they assembled homemade bombs, planted them and monitored the explosion via
      phones with online transmission. As a result of the attack, one National Guard
      member was killed and three others were injured. A second bomb exploded while
      emergency responders were on the scene. The lesson? If there is a military conflict,
      it won''t just be the Russians who try to kill you. It will also be your neighbours,
      acquaintances or even relatives - all those who have turned their failure in
      life into hatred of the democratic system. All those who are already swallowing

    detail: '- Zelensky visited Kupyansk and made a video of it. For the last few
      weeks, the Russians, including Putin himself, have claimed to have conquered
      (or "liberated") the city. The reality is that the Ukrainians managed to push
      the Russians out of most of the city during the counter-attacks and cut off
      several dozen Russian soldiers from supply routes. Thus, most of the city is
      once again under Ukrainian control.

      - Ukrainian armed forces, in cooperation with the Black Spark guerrilla group,
      hit two Russian ships off the coast of the Republic of Kalmykia in the Caspian
      Sea. The ships ''Composer Rachmaninov'' and ''Askar-Saridja'' were carrying
      weapons and military material. Both vessels were sunk.

      - Ukraine successfully struck the Slavneft-JANOS oil refinery in Yaroslavl Region,
      Russia - one of the largest refineries in Russia with an annual production capacity
      of around 15 million tonnes of oil and gas condensate. There were explosions
      and a large fire at the target site.

      - A Russian drone hit an evacuation vehicle of UAnimals, a non-profit animal
      protection organisation, in the Donetsk region. Two UAnimals employees and two
      animals were in the vehicle at the time of the attack. Fortunately, no one was
      killed.

      - The Russian Central Bank has filed a lawsuit in the Moscow Arbitration Court
      against the Belgian depository Euroclear, arguing that its actions caused harm
      by blocking access to Russian assets. Like... yes, that''s the point of the
      asset freeze.

      - Pakistan''s prime minister provided amusement for diplomats and security when
      he lost his temper and, after waiting 40 minutes for President Putin, stormed
      into the room where Putin was meeting with President Erdogan.

      - The famous Russian filmmaker Sokurov harshly criticized Putin during the video
      call, telling him that he was making Russia look like North Korea by banning
      all forms of creativity, and even in the days of the USSR it wasn''t that bad.

      - Bryan Lanza, who served as a senior adviser to US President Donald Trump during
      the 2024 election campaign, has become a consultant to the international division
      of Russian oil company Lukoil.

      - Russian channels are reporting that a Ukrainian drone attack on an AN-26 military
      transport plane at the Kacha airport in occupied Crimea has left personnel injured
      and dead, according to reports.

      - A supposedly more detailed version of the new US National Security Strategy
      has been leaked to the media, according to which the United States wants to
      persuade Austria, Italy, Hungary and Poland to leave the European Union.

      - Russians hit a Turkish ship in Odessa port. According to preliminary information,
      the ship was carrying generators. This is another piece in the puzzle of anti-Russian
      propaganda about "not attacking civilian targets".

      - US "Secretary of War" Hegseth has excluded Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll
      from negotiations on Ukraine. The reason is Driscoll''s "overly proactive stance."

      - NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned, "We must be prepared for a war on
      the scale experienced by our grandparents and great-grandparents."

      - Outgoing Prime Minister Fiala announced that the Czech Republic had delivered
      the promised 1 800 000 pieces of artillery ammunition to Ukraine this year through
      the Ammunition Initiative.

      - Outbreaks of Hong Kong flu have occurred in 17 regions of Russia, mainly in

      proposal. Territories: the US proposes to legitimise Russia''s control over
      Crimea, the "LNR and DNR". Any future changes in status could only be made through
      diplomatic channels. Donetsk Oblast: A demilitarized zone would be created covering
      about 30% of Donetsk. Ukrainian and Russian forces will withdraw beyond its
      borders. Zaporizhzhya and Kherson: The front line will be frozen and the current
      control of the territory will be recognised. Withdrawal of Russian troops: Under
      the proposal, Russia must leave all other occupied territories outside the five
      named regions (e.g. Sumy, Kharkiv or Dnipropetrovsk oblasts). NATO: the US declares
      that the alliance will not expand further and will not accept Ukraine. No NATO
      troops would be allowed to be deployed on Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian army:
      Authorized post-war size is limited to 800,000 troops. Security: Ukraine would
      receive guarantees similar to NATO Article 5, but without any legal force. Elections:
      must be held as soon as possible after the signing of the agreement. Zaporizhzhya
      nuclear power plant: It will be put back into operation under US supervision;
      Ukraine will get 50% of the energy produced. EU: The plan envisages Ukraine
      joining the European Union on 1 January 2027. Russian assets: The US intends
      to partially release Russian assets. Part of the funds would be used for the
      reconstruction of Ukraine, while another part could be directed to joint US-Russia

    detail: '- According to the Wall Street Journal, the United States has made proposals
      to Europe on how Russia could be reintegrated into the global economy. The US
      plan envisages US investment in key Russian industries such as precious metals
      and even envisages helping to restore Russian energy exports to Europe and the
      rest of the world, in stark contrast to the European strategy of cutting Russia
      off from gas supplies. The proposal also outlines how US financial institutions
      and companies could get involved in projects in Ukraine using some USD 200 billion
      of frozen Russian assets. U.S. actions have caused considerable tension in negotiations
      with European allies, who differ sharply in their ideas about Ukraine''s reconstruction
      and the conditions for future normalization of relations with Russia.

      - The UN General Assembly supported a Ukrainian resolution aimed at strengthening
      international cooperation and minimising the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.
      The document received the support of 97 states. Voting against were Russia,
      Belarus, China, North Korea, Nicaragua, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
      Niger and, unfortunately, the USA.

      - For the first time, Ukrainian forces used remote sensing drones to hit Lukoil''s
      Filanovsky oil platforms, located more than 905 km from the front line in the
      Caspian Sea. They were hit by more than four projectiles, resulting in the shutdown
      of oil and gas production from more than 20 wells.

      - Tucker Carlson said Russia would be the best ally for the United States "because
      it''s the largest territory in the world, with a lot of oil, gas, minerals,
      gold and everything else. From an America First policy perspective, it''s an
      ideal ally."

      - The British soldier who died in Ukraine a few days ago was Corporal George
      Hooley, 28, who was serving in a parachute regiment. He was killed while testing
      an interception drone. Two Ukrainians also died in the accident.

      - Ukrainian drones hit the Akron chemical plant in Veliky Novgorod, Russia,
      a major industrial complex located about 200 km from the Estonian border and
      700 km from Ukraine.

      - In occupied Donetsk, near school 115, a bust of Lance Corporal Michael Gloss,
      the son of the CIA deputy director who died fighting on the Russian side, was
      installed.

      - According to Politico, the United States is considering the creation of a
      new "Core 5" group consisting of the US, China, Russia, India and Japan as an
      alternative to the G7.

      - Since this year, every Finnish soldier has been learning to pilot drones,
      drop bombs, shoot down drones and perform maintenance on them.

      - Kazakhstan supplied oil from the Kashagan field to China for the first time
      after Ukrainian strikes crippled the Russian CPC terminal.

      - The United States seized a tanker carrying a cargo of oil from Venezuela to
      Cuba.

      - Military police intervene at a drone collection - Project Nemesis.

      - Zelensky responded to Trump''s blathering about the need for elections in
      Ukraine: he called on the US and Europe to ensure the security of the vote.
      If that happens, he said, Ukraine will be able to hold elections within 60 days.
      Russian officials immediately called that bluff.

      - Republican Thomas Massie introduced a bill in the US Congress to withdraw
      the US from NATO, calling the alliance a "relic of the Cold War" and arguing
      that the funds saved should be spent on US homeland security.

      - Mass seizures of property in occupied territories are now officially legal.
      Occupation authorities have been given the power to declare houses "ownerless"

      - According to Ukrainian intelligence, there is a risk of Russian sabotage and
      reconnaissance groups infiltrating the Odessa and Vinnytsia regions. Intensive
      mobilisation is underway in Transnistria, and mass production of drones and
      training of their operators has started.

      - A video has appeared on Russian social media showing the new commander of
      PMC Wagner''s private army, Dmitry Podolsky, known as "Salem". He lost both

    desc: 'In Russian propaganda, it is regularly claimed that the Russian advance
      is what it is (slow) because the Russian army is extremely considerate of the
      civilian population of Ukraine. What does the Russian "liberation" really look
      like? I guess it looks like this: As soon as any city is within range for Russian
      artillery, the systematic terrorization of the civilian population begins. The
      targets are shops, power stations, waterworks, schools, transport infrastructure...
      in short, everything that the civilian population needs to live a normal life.
      The goal is to make normal life in the city simply unsustainable, so that the
      civilian population will leave as soon as possible and Russia can accelerate
      the devastation of the city, which is now left with practically a fraction of
      people with nowhere to go, soldiers, and collaborators who help to direct the
      attacks on the two previously mentioned groups of people. This goes on for weeks,
      months, sometimes years. By the time the tanks and infantry approach the city,
      it is just an empty ruin. Then Russia literally blows all the remaining, still
      standing buildings to s**t. This is usually the point at which the Ukrainian
      army retreats, leaving only paratroopers, special forces and saboteurs to operate
      in the rubble. For the next few months, the Russians conquer the smoking ruins
      at the cost of tens to hundreds (in the case of villages) or thousands to tens
      of thousands (in the case of district towns) of lives, and when there are no
      Ukrainian soldiers left in the town, the Russians declare the town "liberated"
      and take the surviving collaborators to some godforsaken village outside the
      Urals. Then Ukrainian artillery starts leveling the remaining piles of bricks
      and panels, and after a short pause the whole situation repeats itself a few
      kilometres away. The Russians do not even respect the lives of their own soldiers,
      let alone foreign civilians. Then, when the Ukrainian army is far enough away,
      the "reconstruction of the liberated city" begins. This looks like a Chinese
      company moving in on a designated site, building prefabricated boxes instead
      of the original tenements and apartment blocks, moving in a few poor people
      who have believed the domestic propaganda about fabulous real estate at fabulous
      prices, Russian state television coming in to film a glorified report, and the
      new tenants being left to their fate in crumbling apartments without electricity
      or water. The thoughtfulness of it all is oozing out. But there is also [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0qsnqyizr698FAiKU4EBmtoe4bZ4o7i7xZDTZuxBXzdrNsBWi6C3V3eq4H3LMEEtnl):

      \ him, Witkoff and Kushner. But yesterday Zelensky let it be known that the\

      \ story printed by the satirical Croatian media outlet Newsbar. According to\
      \ the article, a virtual minister named Diella was removed from her post for\
      \ accepting a bribe of 14 bitcoins during a selection process. Volodin did not\
      \ understand that this was a humorous story.\n- When asked by reporters, Trump\
      \ said that \"Russia now has a stronger negotiating position because it's bigger.\"\
      \ He said Zelensky should start accepting offers of reconciliation because he\
      \ is losing on the battlefield. For context, it is worth recalling that according\
      \ to the still valid Budapest Memorandum, the United States (but also Russia)\
      \ is the guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n- The International\
      \ Court of Justice in The Hague has formally accepted Russian charges against\
      \ Ukraine for alleged genocide in the Donbas. Thus, Ukraine must submit a response\
      \ to Russia's allegations by December 7, 2026. Russia must submit its charges\
      \ by December 7, 2027.\n- Trump said that \"it has always been the general consensus,\
      \ even long before Putin, that Ukraine would not be admitted to NATO.\" If he\
      \ wasn't lying, he was inadvertently confirming that Russian propaganda about\
      \ the need to invade Ukraine to expand NATO is being sucked out of thin air.\n\
      - The four men accused of murdering Russell Bentley, an American communist and\
      \ propagandist who fought in the Donbas since 2014 on the side of pro-Russian\
      \ militants, were sentenced to prison terms of up to 12 years.\n- Russian domestic\
      \ propaganda continues to prepare the Russian population for a larger war with\
      \ Europe that could come within months or years of Trump forcing Ukraine to\
      \ capitulate.\n- A Russian An-22 military transport plane crashed in the Ivanovo\
      \ region. Seven people were on board, their fate is still unknown, but it is\
      \ believed that they did not survive the crash.\n- Honduras has issued an international\

      war against the whole of Europe. Sergei Karaganov, chairman of the Russian Council
      on Foreign and Defence Policy, said on television that the current war will
      not end until Russia "morally and politically" crushes Europe, because, he said,
      the current European elites are "pushing the world towards a global war". Europe,
      he said, will disintegrate and become "a junkyard of nations at war with each
      other" because it is a source of "evil for all humanity". European propaganda,
      he said, has created an indoctrinated population worse than that of Germany
      at the end of the Second World War. Karaganov therefore hopes that "Europeans
      will come to their senses before Russia has to resort to mass retaliation".

      Donbass. But he insists that peace talks should be derived from the current
      front, not from Russian demands. Indeed, to give up the Donbas would mean ceding
      to Russia a multi-layered defence and a belt of fortress cities built up over
      many years and at the cost of unimaginable losses. Ceding them would also allow
      Russia to use them as footholds for an invasion of the rest of Ukraine.

      - Russia ranks 28th out of 36 in the latest Global AI Ecosystem Development
      Index. Even the best Russian models lag behind older versions of ChatGPT and
      Gemini. While Putin recently identified AI development as a strategic priority,
      thousands of IT talents have left Russia for the West due to emerging totalitarianism
      and war. So now there is no intelligence in Russia. Neither real nor artificial.

      - The European Commission is proposing to distribute financial guarantees among
      EU member states to provide Ukraine with a "reparation loan" financed by frozen
      Russian assets. These guarantees are necessary to persuade Belgium to confiscate
      the 185 billion euros deposited in Euroclear. A further €25 billion is scattered
      across the Union in private bank accounts.

      - Zelensky held talks with European leaders in Britain. The British Prime Minister
      began his address to him by saying "We stand with Ukraine" and stressed that
      any potential ceasefire must be fair and lasting and that decisions on Ukraine
      must be made primarily by Ukraine.

      - Trump let it be known that he was disappointed by the lack of any response
      from Zelensky to Trump''s peace plan. According to Trump, Russia is ready to
      make a deal and Zelensky''s team is said to be excited about it. So sure...

      - According to Zelensky, "overtly un-Ukrainian" proposals were removed from
      the peace plan after the first rounds of negotiations. The draft subsequently
      presented by Witkoff in Moscow was therefore cut from 28 to 20 points.

      - On one of the Russian bombers parked in the hangar, the ejection system suddenly
      activated, with the crew already inside at the time. As a result, the pilot
      and navigator were killed.

      - According to the Ukrainian ombudsman, the Kremlin is preparing a new hybrid
      attack: staged "anti-war" demonstrations across Ukraine, for which it is recruiting
      mothers of fallen soldiers.

      - Russia has charged Robert "Hungarian" Brovdi in absentia for organizing an
      alleged terrorist attack in Russia''s Kursk region and issued an international
      arrest warrant for him.

      - Cambodia and Thailand - the same countries Trump previously claimed he helped

      \ without any further negotiations or compensation during a phone call between\
      \ him, Witkoff and Kushner. But yesterday Zelensky let it be known that the\
      \ Ukrainian representation has no option under Ukrainian, international, and\
      \ ultimately moral law to hand over Ukrainian territories to anyone.\n- Volodin,\
      \ the speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, cited a fake news\
      \ report to justify the upcoming AI regulation in Russia. In his speech to Putin,\
      \ he mentioned a media story about a \"corrupt AI minister in Albania\" - a\
      \ story printed by the satirical Croatian media outlet Newsbar. According to\
      \ the article, a virtual minister named Diella was removed from her post for\
      \ accepting a bribe of 14 bitcoins during a selection process. Volodin did not\
      \ understand that this was a humorous story.\n- When asked by reporters, Trump\
      \ said that \"Russia now has a stronger negotiating position because it's bigger.\"\
      \ He said Zelensky should start accepting offers of reconciliation because he\
      \ is losing on the battlefield. For context, it is worth recalling that according\
      \ to the still valid Budapest Memorandum, the United States (but also Russia)\
      \ is the guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n- The International\
      \ Court of Justice in The Hague has formally accepted Russian charges against\
      \ Ukraine for alleged genocide in the Donbas. Thus, Ukraine must submit a response\
      \ to Russia's allegations by December 7, 2026. Russia must submit its charges\
      \ by December 7, 2027.\n- Trump said that \"it has always been the general consensus,\
      \ even long before Putin, that Ukraine would not be admitted to NATO.\" If he\
      \ wasn't lying, he was inadvertently confirming that Russian propaganda about\
      \ the need to invade Ukraine to expand NATO is being sucked out of thin air.\n\

      \ propagandist who fought in the Donbas since 2014 on the side of pro-Russian\

      \ capitulate.\n- A Russian An-22 military transport plane crashed in the Ivanovo\
      \ region. Seven people were on board, their fate is still unknown, but it is\

    desc: 'In Russian propaganda, it is regularly claimed that the Russian advance
      is what it is (slow) because the Russian army is extremely considerate of the
      civilian population of Ukraine. What does the Russian "liberation" really look
      like? I guess it looks like this: As soon as any city is within range for Russian
      artillery, the systematic terrorization of the civilian population begins. The
      target is shops, power stations, waterworks, schools, transport infrastructure...
      in short, everything that the civilian population needs to live a normal life.
      The goal is to make normal life in the city simply unsustainable, so that the
      civilian population will leave as soon as possible and Russia can accelerate
      the devastation of the city, which is now left with practically a fraction of
      people with nowhere to go, soldiers, and collaborators who help to direct the
      attacks on the two previously mentioned groups of people. This goes on for weeks,
      months, sometimes years. By the time the tanks and infantry approach the city,
      it is just an empty ruin. Then Russia literally blows all the remaining, still
      standing buildings to s**t. This is usually the point at which the Ukrainian
      army retreats, leaving only paratroopers, special forces and saboteurs to operate
      in the rubble. For the next few months, the Russians conquer the smoking ruins
      at the cost of tens to hundreds (in the case of villages) or thousands to tens
      of thousands (in the case of district towns) of lives, and when there are no
      Ukrainian soldiers left in the town, the Russians declare the town "liberated"
      and take the surviving collaborators to some godforsaken village across the
      Urals. Then Ukrainian artillery starts leveling the remaining piles of bricks
      and panels, and after a short pause the whole situation repeats itself a few
      kilometres away. The Russians do not even respect the lives of their own soldiers,
      let alone foreign civilians. Then, when the Ukrainian army is far enough away,
      the "reconstruction of the liberated city" begins. This looks like a Chinese
      company moving in on a selected site, building prefabricated boxes instead of
      the original tenements and apartment blocks, moving in a few poor people who
      have believed the domestic propaganda about fabulous real estate at fabulous
      prices, Russian state television coming in to film a glorified report, and the
      new tenants being left to their fate in crumbling apartments without electricity
      or water. The thoughtfulness of it all is oozing out. But there is also [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0qsnqyizr698FAiKU4EBmtoe4bZ4o7i7xZDTZuxBXzdrNsBWi6C3V3eq4H3LMEEtnl):

      Donbass. But he insists that peace talks should be derived from the current
      front, not from Russian demands. Indeed, to give up the Donbas would mean ceding
      to Russia a multi-layered defence and a belt of fortress cities built up over
      many years and at the cost of unimaginable losses. Ceding them would also allow
      Russia to use them as footholds for an invasion of the rest of Ukraine.

      - Russia ranks 28th out of 36 in the latest Global AI Ecosystem Development
      Index. Even the best Russian models lag behind older versions of ChatGPT and
      Gemini. While Putin recently identified AI development as a strategic priority,
      thousands of IT talents have left Russia for the West due to emerging totalitarianism
      and war. So now there is no intelligence in Russia. Neither real nor artificial.

      - The European Commission is proposing to distribute financial guarantees among
      EU member states to provide Ukraine with a "reparation loan" financed by frozen
      Russian assets. These guarantees are necessary to persuade Belgium to confiscate
      the 185 billion euros deposited in Euroclear. A further €25 billion is scattered
      across the Union in private bank accounts.

      - Zelensky held talks with European leaders in Britain. The British Prime Minister
      began his address to him by saying "We stand with Ukraine" and stressed that
      any potential ceasefire must be fair and lasting and that decisions on Ukraine
      must be made primarily by Ukraine.

      - Trump let it be known that he was disappointed by the lack of any response
      from Zelensky to Trump''s peace plan. According to Trump, Russia is ready to
      make a deal and Zelensky''s team is said to be excited about it. So sure...

      - According to Zelensky, "overtly un-Ukrainian" proposals were removed from
      the peace plan after the first rounds of negotiations. The draft subsequently
      presented by Witkoff in Moscow was therefore cut from 28 to 20 points.

      - On one of the Russian bombers parked in the hangar, the ejection system suddenly
      activated, with the crew already inside at the time. As a result, the pilot
      and navigator were killed.

      attack: staged "anti-war" demonstrations across Ukraine, for which it is recruiting
      mothers of fallen soldiers.

      - Russia has charged Robert "Hungarian" Brovdi in absentia for organizing an
      alleged terrorist attack in Russia''s Kursk region and issued an international

      - Ukrainian drones destroyed 70% of the fuel tanks in the Russian port of Temryuk.

      - Russia has sacrificed up to 1.35 million troops to gain 1.45% of Ukraine''s

      war against the whole of Europe. Sergei Karaganov, chairman of the Russian Council
      on Foreign and Defence Policy, said on television that the current war will
      not end until Russia "morally and politically" crushes Europe, because, he said,
      the current European elites are "pushing the world towards a global war". Europe,
      he said, will disintegrate and become "a junkyard of nations at war with each
      other" because it is the source of "evil for all humanity". European propaganda,

      - Kremlin spokesman Peskov let it be known that Russia welcomes the new US national
      security strategy. First, because unlike the strategies of previous administrations,

      of Europe." All of this is aided by technocrats like Musk and Durov, who, moreover,
      have already bent the algorithms of their networks in the past to spread such
      propaganda more quickly. Ironically, Russian leaders such as Medvedev and Dmitriyev
      have been widely sharing and commenting on calls to ''end censorship'' across
      all known networks, even though all Western social networks, including Facebook,
      Instagram and X, are banned in Russia. So far, the sharpest reaction in top
      politics has been demonstrated by Polish Foreign Minister Sikorski, who told
      Musk to "fly to Mars where no one will censor Nazi salutes." But the key information
      is that Russia (of course) wants the EU and NATO to break up so that it can
      more easily attack individual states. And anyone who seeks to do the same is
      - consciously or unconsciously - an agent of Russia. Even if it is the US president.

    detail: '- The national poll found that 64% of Americans support providing lethal
      aid to Ukraine, up 9% from last year and the highest share since February 2022.
      Slightly more (65%) support providing long-range missiles like Tomahawks so
      Ukraine can conduct strikes deep inside Russian territory, while 68% support
      selling U.S.-made weapons to European allies who would then provide them to
      Ukraine. By contrast, in 2024, a majority of Republicans (59%) support supplying
      weapons to Ukraine to repel a Russian invasion, up from 44% last year. Three-quarters
      of Democrats support aid to Ukraine, up from 68%. The poll also found that 62%
      of Americans want the war to end with a Ukrainian victory.

      - Russia''s pro-regime military channels fret that Siberian peoples, including
      the Buryats who were colonized long ago, are being decimated in the so-called
      "SVO" while "economic migrants from Central Asia" fill the resulting gaps. The
      arrival of these migrants, they say, is already showing up on the streets, where
      a growing number of "women with their faces covered" can be seen. Thus, while
      Russia funds far-right movements in Europe that fight migration and the ''Islamisation''
      of Europe, Russia has the largest Muslim minority of the ''non-Muslim countries''
      in Europe. Russia is now home to more than 1% of the world''s Muslim population,
      and its share of the Russian population is growing year by year.

      - The Kherson heating plant is definitely out of action after about a hundred
      hits by Russian artillery. This threatens to leave some 30 000 inhabitants of
      the adjacent villages without electricity during the winter. Meanwhile, in 2022,
      after a fake referendum, the Russians claimed that 87% of the region wanted
      to join Russia. If we were to believe their lie, it would mean that the Russians
      have been terrorizing a population they consider ''theirs'' for three years
      without ceasing.

      - Republican politicians and influencers, with the hearty backing of Russian
      and pro-Russian accounts, flooded social media with claims that the European
      Union had fined X/Twitter because Elon Musk refused the Union''s request to
      deploy censorship. In fact, the network was fined for refusing to address transparency
      issues with some features instead.

      - International Criminal Court Deputy Prosecutor Najat Shammim Khan said that
      the investigation into Russian aggression can be suspended for peace talks if
      the UN Security Council requests it.

      - Zakharova said that "the attacks on tankers in the Black Sea and on the infrastructure
      of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium are further examples of the criminal nature
      of the Kiev regime."

      - One of the commanding officers of the 414th "Klim" Brigade was awarded the
      title of Hero of Ukraine and the entire 414th "Hungarian Birds" Brigade received
      its battle standard from the President.

      - According to the IAEA, the radiation sarcophagus of the Chernobyl nuclear
      power plant lost its integrity after the Russian kamikaze drone attack and with
      it its primary safety function.

      - The Swedish Navy reports regular contacts with Russian submarines in the Baltic
      Sea on an almost weekly basis.

      - Russia will raise the tax on alcohol by 30 percent to raise money for its
      war spending.

      - Ukrainian drones again hit a Russian oil refinery in Ryazan.

      - The US offered Poland 250 Stryker armoured vehicles for $1.

    desc: 'Ukraine was supposed to celebrate the feast of St. Nicholas last night.
      Instead, the Russians "gifted" it with another night of terror of the civilian
      population. There were a total of 683 drones and 51 cruise missiles/flares in
      the air. During the raid, the Russians completely destroyed the railway station
      in the town of Fastiv in the Kiev region. In Dnipro, the warehouse of a popular
      chocolate factory there was hit, as well as a storage area full of medical supplies.
      Debris from one of the rockets landed on a playground in the city centre. Another
      plant was also hit, in western Ukraine near Lutsk. But the Russian report almost
      certainly tells of "decisive strikes on NATO bases full of Western generals
      and fighter jets". Nothing new under the sun. But this [is new](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0br4kPwYoHh2iHA3pkH2fiCsTjAmD745BDS8tVujX6MG4XCVatz14Ah1M5Fn94KfZl):

    desc: '31 years ago today, Ukraine signed a series of international agreements
      known collectively as the "Budapest Memorandum". It gave up, among other things,
      its nuclear arsenal in exchange for several countries guaranteeing its security.
      The reality? Of the three guarantors, one has repeatedly attacked it, another
      has tried to sell it to the first, and only one - the UK - has kept its word,
      at least in part. So Russia and the US have basically told every country in
      the world that having nuclear weapons is the only way to keep the peace. Because
      the most vague agreements are only worth the paper they are written on. And

      a strategic defeat, simply because no one realistically wants the subsequent

    desc: 'In a televised interview, former Russian ground forces commander Vladimir
      Valentinovich Chirkin publicly admitted the fiasco of the Kremlin''s original
      strategy for invading Ukraine. According to him, the Russian intelligence services
      assured the Kremlin that 70% of Ukrainians would support Russia and only 30%
      would oppose it. In fact, the exact opposite was the case - and this, in his
      view, became one of the factors that led to the failure of the "three-day special
      operation". Chirkin also complained that the Russian army grossly "underestimated
      the enemy and overestimated itself" and that the capture of Kiev failed because
      of this, leading to a chaotic retreat from northern Ukraine. The then Defence
      Minister Shoigu is said to have tried to handle the situation gracefully, calling
      what was happening a "gesture of goodwill". We remember that very well, of course.
      The funny thing is that even though Putin''s fiasco has now been admitted by
      a top Russian military official, the Russian fifth column will still continue
      to parrot the propaganda that this was an agreed withdrawal. On the other hand,
      propaganda from the Russian FSB can apparently lie very effectively even to
      its own politicians. So we cannot be surprised that it is so easily succumbed
      to by individuals much less mentally equipped than the Russian President. But

    detail: '- Turkish maritime authorities report that another tanker sailing from
      Russia to Georgia - the MIDVOLGA-2 - has been targeted 80 miles off the Turkish
      coast. But Ukraine - unlike in past attacks - has said it had nothing to do
      with this particular incident and that it may have been a Russian provocation
      aimed at provoking a negative response from Turkish officials. According to
      Putin, in response to the tanker attacks, Russia will increase attacks on Ukrainian
      ports and ships calling at those ports. So here is the possible pretext.

      - The SBU has detained a British instructor who came to Ukraine in 2024 ostensibly
      to train Ukrainian soldiers. According to investigators, he was actually working
      for Russian intelligence: gathering information and supplying the weapons used
      to kill Demyan Hanul, Iryna Farionova and Andriy Parubiy.

      - A Russian sabotage group tried to slip through the ruins of Myrnohrad under
      the cover of fog. A group of Russians broke into a ruined house in the centre
      of Myrnohrad, but was detected by a Ukrainian drone. Ukrainian troops took advantage
      of the poor visibility and quietly surrounded the Russians, who surrendered
      without resistance.

      - Trump gave Maduro until last Friday to leave Venezuela with his family. According
      to two sources cited by Reuters, it was the expiration of the deadline that
      prompted Trump to announce the closure of Venezuelan airspace on Saturday.

      - The U.S. suspended some arms shipments to Ukraine and cut off one of the direct
      lines of communication with German generals who were coordinating aid to Kiev.
      The information came from German General Christian Freuding in an interview
      with The Atlantic magazine.

      - November set a new record for the number of attacks on Russian refineries.
      According to Bloomberg, August held the previous record with 12 attacks. Now
      Ukrainian forces have set a new record: at least 14 attacks on Russian oil infrastructure.

      - Putin met with the head of Russia''s Federal Prison Service, who told him
      that more than 90% of Russia''s convicted prisoners are now "employed." He forgot
      to add that in the Russian military.

      - The Russians complain on their channels that Ukrainian artillery is decimating
      Russian supplies to Pokrovsk, making things difficult for the troops holding
      positions in the city.

      - According to a Russian internal poll, 83% of Russians feel war fatigue, 56%
      want an immediate end to the war and support for its continuation has dropped
      to just 23%.

      - The payment service Wise has started blocking the cards of Russian and Belarusian
      citizens who do not have permanent residence or citizenship in an EEA country.

      - In recent weeks, Ukrainian military intelligence drones have been striking
      valuable pieces of Russian air defence equipment in occupied Crimea on an almost
      daily basis.

      - The Russian State Duma ratified an agreement that allows Russia and India
      to send their troops and military equipment to each other''s territory.

      - One person was killed and five others injured in a Russian attack on a nine-storey
      apartment building in Kramatorsk.

      - Putin said that if Europe starts a war with Russia, Moscow will soon have
      no one to negotiate with.

      - Italy approved a 12th military aid package to Ukraine. However, its contents
      remain secret.

      - The Russians cannot start their Porsches today because of software blocks.

      '
    desc: 'Witkoff and Trump''s son-in-law Kushner arrived in Moscow this morning
      for talks. Putin has already set the stage for the talks in advance by having
      a bizarre propaganda video filmed in which he appears dressed in military camouflage
      and discusses with military and defense ministry officials the breathtaking
      advance on the front and the initiative, which he says is 100 percent in the
      hands of the Russian military. In the video, it is said, among other things,
      that the Russian army has captured the whole of Pokrovsk or Vovchansk, which
      independent analysts say is simply not true, or that the Russian army has "launched
      an operation to liberate the town of Hulyaipol". On this account, Zelensky confirmed
      in his meeting with Macron that there is still fighting in Pokrovsk, and reminded
      that Russia has repeatedly claimed to have captured Kupyansk, while most of
      the city is still held by Ukrainian forces, systematically destroying Russian
      assault groups that infiltrate the city. However, the video is probably intended
      to impress primarily one potential viewer: Donald Trump. And that''s where Putin
      has an easy time with persuasion, as recent weeks have made clear. Alarmingly,
      however, the Chinese foreign minister flew to Moscow at the same time as the
      Americans for talks. And this is also happening [this](https://www.facebook.com/dnesnaukrajine.cz/posts/pfbid0vncBRAbAijGFX7FG8kN5Fa4vkPmxb3csFE7E8gkNJ2JKYYotCydahMDVsmhHCdokl):

    detail: '- 34 years ago today, Ukraine clearly voted in a national referendum
      that it did not want to be part of the Russian world. At that time, 83% of all
      the inhabitants of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions voted in favour of Ukrainian
      independence, and even 54% of the inhabitants of Crimea, which the Russians
      had been systematically colonising for decades, replacing the indigenous population
      with ethnic Russians.

      - According to new information, one of the victims of yesterday''s Russian airstrike
      on Vyshhorod is one of the team of missile designers at FirePoint, the company
      that produces Flamingo missiles. So it was not a stray missile or downed debris,
      but a totally targeted strike, in which the Russians took no account of how
      many other people - civilians - would die in the strike.

      - Ukrainian military intelligence launched another successful bomb attack on
      the occupiers in Berdyansk. This time, a bomb exploded under a propaganda billboard
      at the entrance to the town, where the occupiers were holding a meeting. The
      explosion killed 5 of them, wounded 4 others and also damaged their armoured
      vehicles.

      - Russia is escalating its control over the internet. Threats of fines have
      not brought the expected shift of Russians away from VPN services. As a result,
      Russians are now losing access to the internet altogether. When a connection
      provider detects VPN access, it simply cuts the connection.

      - A car exploded in a Moscow housing estate. According to reports, the car belonged
      to a scientist from the Moscow Laser Research Institute "Polyus", a doctor of
      physical and mathematical sciences. But the vehicle was empty at the time.

      - NATO manoeuvres have begun in Finland near the Russian border. The Northern
      Axe 25 exercise is taking place in the Kainuu region, which borders Karelia.
      More than 3,000 troops are taking part, including troops from the UK.

      - Putin signs a draft state budget with a record large component for the defence
      ministry. Russia will spend at least $166 billion on the war against Ukraine
      in 2026.

      - The Netherlands has committed to buy 250 million euros ($290 million) worth
      of US weapons for Kiev in a PURL mechanism.

      - Kazakhstan and Turkey have asked Ukraine to stop attacking elements of Russian
      oil infrastructure in the Black Sea.

      - The Russians sent ballistic missiles to Dnipro in broad daylight. One of them
      hit a residential area, killing four people and injuring approximately 40 others.

      - Putin signed a decree allowing Chinese citizens 30-day visa-free entry into
      Russia.

      - Almost half of Russian oil companies are now losing money because of the sanctions.

      - Zelensky met with Macron in Paris and is due to visit Ireland for the first
      time tomorrow.

      - Russia has announced that it will begin evacuating its citizens from Venezuela.

    desc: 'On Twitter, Telegram and TikTok there is currently another continuation
      of the Russian campaign "why there is no footage of the fighting in Ukraine".
      This time the narrative being peddled is "If the Russian army is so bad, why
      isn''t it executing defenseless Ukrainian prisoners?" In fact, just in the last
      few days, several videos have emerged showing the Russians doing exactly that.
      And that''s why Russian propaganda is reacting this way. This type of propaganda
      is designed to put the complete opposition to any claim and create the impression
      in the minds of less informed people that the truth either does not exist or
      is "somewhere in the middle". At the same time, it relies on the fact that the
      vast majority of the population will never see such hard evidence (videos),
      partly because such content does not penetrate them, but also because even if
      it did, most people would rather not view it - they are not built for such raw
      content. Often, such Russian propaganda takes on completely absurd, cynical
      forms, denying even the most basic facts just so that there will be a "contrary
      opinion". In the same vein, the Russians spread claims such as the aforementioned
      "where is some footage of the war?" (as if there were none) or "there is no
      evidence that the Russians bombed civilians" (even though they do it every day
      and most of it is on video). But you''ve known that for a long time, so let''s

      the Americans want to resolve all "territorial disputes" between Ukraine and
      Russia today so that they can present the plan to Putin on Tuesday. But Ukraine
      has no "territorial disputes" with Russia. Russia illegally occupies Ukrainian
      territory.

      - Today, Ukrainians hit another tanker from Russia''s shadow fleet with a naval
      drone. This time, however, it was extremely far away: off the coast of Senegal.
      After the hit, the tanker M/T Mersin started to take on water quickly and by
      now it will probably be somewhere on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

      - A Russian plan to build new icebreakers for operations in the Arctic has collapsed
      because replacing foreign components has proved too costly given the sanctions
      in place against Russia.

      - The Republican-led House Armed Services Committee is now investigating Trump
      and Pete Hegseth for possible war crimes. Both are also now under investigation
      by the House and Senate.

      - One person was killed and 19 others injured in the Russian attack on Vyshorod.
      Kiev regional governor Mykola Kalashnyk said that one child was among the injured.

      - On 28 November, the Russian Ministry of Justice designated Human Rights Watch
      as an "undesirable organisation", effectively banning it from operating in the
      country.

      - Ukrainian military intelligence carried out a successful bomb attack on a
      group of Kadyrovs who had made a business of reselling fuel in Berdyansk.

      - The Ukrainian military said it was testing new means to neutralise Russian
      KAB guided aerial bombs, having already destroyed nearly 100 since September.

    title: Saturday
    detail: '- According to The Wall Street Journal, US officials were not 100% informed
      about the details of the negotiations between Steve Witkoff and Kirill Dmitriev.
      According to WSJ sources, the negotiations between Dmitriev and Witkoff lasted
      nine months. Officials in the U.S. Treasury Department''s Sanctions Review Division
      often learned about the details of these meetings only from their British counterparts.
      Ahead of a planned Russia-U.S. summit in Alaska, Dmitriev and Witkoff reportedly
      discussed a possible prisoner swap. According to the CIA and the State Department,
      they were not fully briefed on these discussions. Then, a few days after the
      Anchorage summit, the European Intelligence and Situation Centre sent a report
      to several senior European national security officials. The contents of the
      document ''shocked'' European officials because it described the trade and economic
      plans that the US and Russia were discussing together. Among them was a rare
      metals mining project in the Arctic, with a stake in the project going to a
      longtime friend of Trump Jr.

      - The Russian fascist state organised another massive raid on the Ukrainian
      capital last night. The Russian military used 36 missiles and 596 drones against
      targets in Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, 577 missiles were
      destroyed by air defenses. Half of Kiev is without electricity and there are
      at least 2 dead and 37 wounded in the city. The New Post Office distribution
      centre, the Terminal shopping centre and several residential buildings were
      hit.

      - German naval bases recorded the highest number of drone sightings in October,
      with the total volume of overflights over military bases reaching record levels.
      Until now, however, the primary targets for reconnaissance have been German
      army and air force facilities.

      - The Ukrainians have added tankers from the Russian shadow fleet sailing through
      the Black Sea to their "sanctions list". Sea Baby naval drones hit two of these
      tankers last night: the Kairos and the Virat, which were on their way to Novorossiysk
      to load oil.

      - Russian forces now control approximately 30% of Kupyansk. Small infantry units
      are operating in the city, but the area west of the Oskil River remains a grey
      zone which the Russians are unable to effectively resupply because of the heavy
      losses caused by Ukrainian drones.

      - At the Yasnyy test range near Orenburg, a rocket exploded after barely leaving
      the ground during a practice launch. Ukraine''s Defense Express suggested it
      may have been a Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile.

      - The Ukrainian military attacked the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) naval
      terminal near Novorossiysk using naval drones. As a result, one of the berths
      was severely damaged and can no longer be used.

      - The special economic zone in Yelabuza, where the Russians assemble their Shaheeds,
      is in flames. The fire broke out in a battery factory that produces cells for
      cars and trucks such as Lada.

      - Swedish Foreign Minister: ''It is obvious that Russia does not want peace.

      the strength of institutions even in the current difficult times. A strength

      and the small shift in the front. Cases of war crimes by Russian soldiers are
      therefore multiplying. In recent days, several videos have emerged of Russians
      shooting handcuffed Ukrainian prisoners. Most recently, another video emerged
      yesterday of Russians shooting five defenceless, lying soldiers after capturing
      and interrogating them following a chaotic Ukrainian retreat to sections of
      the frontline near the town of Hulyaipol. Another video, this time from the
      helmet camera of a Russian soldier, captured his colleague first bashing the
      head of a handcuffed Ukrainian prisoner with the butt of his rifle and then
      shooting him. The crime took place near Hnativka, near Pokrovsk.

      - The Baikonur accident has virtually deprived Russia of the ability to send
      people into space for the first time in 60 years. During the launch of the Soyuz
      MS-28, the service tower on launch pad 31 collapsed. This is the only place
      from which crews can be sent to the International Space Station. The astronauts
      escaped unharmed, but the ramp was severely damaged and some estimates suggest
      it could take up to two years to repair.

      - Trump''s peace plan, reportedly agreed to by Ukraine, was delivered to the
      Kremlin. An updated version is being kept secret even from European officials.
      According to one diplomat, the contents are deliberately being kept secret because
      of the leak of the previous US 28-point plan to the press.

      - Belgium is throwing a pitchfork into the EU''s plan to use frozen Russian
      assets as a "reparations loan" to Ukraine. Politico reports that Prime Minister
      Bart De Wever sent a letter to Ursula von der Leyen arguing that confiscating
      Russian assets would prevent peace.

      - The head of European diplomacy recalled that Russia has invaded more than
      19 countries in the last 100 years, some of them three or four times. None of
      these countries has ever attacked Russia.

      - Russian collaborator and current Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán arrived
      in the Kremlin for talks with dictator Putin on energy supplies and a peace
      plan for Ukraine.

      - One of the four Ukrainians who were arrested in Poland on suspicion of sabotaging
      the Polish railroad was carrying a whopping 46 Russian passports and other Russian
      documents.

      - The Russian Safari has more tragic victims. Russians hit an FPV passenger
      car with a drone in Kherson, killing 34-year-old Alina and her 6-year-old son
      Vladyslav.

      - The European Parliament adopts a resolution demanding that the EU be invited
      to the negotiating table and that frozen Russian assets be handed over to Kiev.

      - Zelensky did not sign Trump''s original peace proposal. Meanwhile, Trump''s
      deadline for signing it expired at midnight today.

      - Moldovan authorities have begun revoking the citizenship of ethnic Russians
      with Moldovan citizenship who have joined the Russian military.

      - A 21-year-old Ukrainian man died in Vienna. His body was found in a burnt-out
      car. Police do not yet know who killed the man.

      - Actors Ivan Trojan and Jiří Dvořák brought ambulances and medical material
      from the Memory of the Nation collection to Ukraine.

      Russian energy infrastructure, including the Saratov oil refinery, was also
      hit. Explosions have also been heard in Smolensk and Saky in Crimea, for example.
      Ukrainian drones also again hit the Beriyev plant in Taganrog. The total extent
      of the damage caused by the overnight airstrike is not yet known. Of course,
      Russian official sources are keeping the successful hits under wraps, so there

      Ukraine is now the only country that is actually fighting this war, and we are

      beyond Ukraine''s borders" if the war was not ended quickly.

      - A Russian flight attendant working for Ural Airlines was sentenced to seven

      own soldiers in the village of Mainila, near the Finnish border, to falsely
      accuse Finland of military aggression and to create a pretext for its forthcoming
      invasion. In the ensuing Winter War, Finland inflicted absolutely crushing losses
      on Moscow''s armies, yet lost part of Karelia and several islands. Stalin justified
      the war by, among other things, the need to create a buffer zone near Leningrad
      (now St Petersburg). Unlike Putin''s virtually identical lies, however, the
      world leaders of the day did not fall for it and expelled the Soviet Union from
      the League of Nations. History repeats itself. Or as they also say, history

      combat operations indefinitely. Driscoll also argued that the situation in Ukraine
      will only worsen over time and that it is better to reach a peaceful settlement
      now than to find oneself in an even weaker position in the future. But military
      analysts say these claims are simply not true, especially the one about the
      endless possibilities for Russia, which has long teetered on the edge of an
      economic precipice. Although the situation on the battlefield is undoubtedly
      unfavourable for the Ukrainians, the whole thing comes across more as a creation
      of pressure than an objective assessment of reality.

      - Counter-intelligence in Paris arrested a Frenchman and a woman of Russian
      origin with a French passport. They are accused of "collaborating with a foreign
      state" and gathering information for Moscow. According to the media, they are
      believed to be Anna Novikova, founder of the "SOS Donbass" organisation. The
      second detainee is Vincent Perfetti, the current head of the organisation.

      - The Speaker of the Moldovan Parliament, Igor Grosu, announced that Moscow
      tried to influence the parliamentary elections held on 28 September by massively
      supporting pro-Russian candidates and even using Moldovan criminal structures
      to do so. It is the same everywhere.

      - Russia claims that it will not make any concessions as part of the peace agreement
      on the war with Ukraine. Trump has made similar statements, letting it be known
      that Russia''s concession is already that it will stop attacking and taking
      more territory.

      - The Russians continue to systematically destroy Ukrainian power plants and
      key energy substations in order to cause the total collapse of the Ukrainian
      energy system and with it the entire Ukrainian society during the coming winter.

    title: Monday
    detail: '- Russian forces broke through Ukrainian defences north of Hulayapol
      after capturing Uspenivka, a key Ukrainian stronghold on the west bank of the
      Janchul River. The breakthrough came after Russia concentrated some 40,000 troops
      on the fortress and fired over 400 shells a day to destroy all fortifications.
      After capturing Uspenivka, Russian forces advanced along a 15-kilometre front
      and penetrated as deep as 8 kilometres. The Ukrainian command ordered a withdrawal
      to the Zarichna River, prioritizing personnel protection over holding problematic
      positions. The river line offers favorable terrain for continued defense.

      - The Russian neo-Nazi and ideologue Dugin wrote on Telegram that Russia will
      occupy all of Ukraine within two years, thus ending Ukrainian sovereignty for
      good, because "Ukrainians don''t know what to do with it." In the text, Dugin
      also says that Russia has developed a detailed plan to integrate Ukrainian society
      into the "Russian world," which includes new textbooks, books, "mass re-education"
      programs, or new names for Ukrainian regions and cities. According to Dugin,
      it is still being debated whether Ukrainian, which he calls a "neo-Nazi dialect,"
      should be preserved or completely erased.

      - Ukrainian media report that Washington has handed Kiev a separate draft of
      new security guarantees. It contains three points: if Russia launches another
      offensive, the US president will have the authority to deploy US armed forces
      and intelligence assets. NATO - along with France, Britain, Germany, Poland
      and Finland - will be required to act in coordination with the United States.
      The guarantees would remain in place for 10 years.

      - Russia destroyed the last functioning power unit in the Chernihiv region after
      three days of incessant airstrikes. The Chernihivoblenergo facility was hit
      directly, its equipment completely destroyed. Concrete walls were in place,
      but the roof was not completed and the entire shelter would take months to complete
      and cost tens of millions more.

      - Other sources confirm: Ukrainian paratroopers from the 425th "Skala" regiment
      fought their way back into the centre of Pokrovsk and drove Russian forces out
      of the area around the railway station, the pedagogical school and Sobornyi
      Park. These actions have so far blocked Russian attempts to regroup and reinforce
      from the north. Any Russian movement across the railway line now faces heavy
      casualties.

      - Ukrainian media, citing sources, report that negotiations between the Ukrainian
      and US delegations in Geneva have hit two major obstacles - the withdrawal of
      Ukrainian armed forces from the Donbas and Ukraine''s membership in NATO.

      - An unnamed U.S. official described the situation at the White House: "You
      tell Trump, ''I''m going to try to make a deal,'' he says, ''Great, we''ll see
      what we can do,'' and that''s about all he knows about it."

      - Russian military channels say North Korean soldiers will be deployed to fight
      on the Zaporizhzhya front in Ukraine after two months of training in Russia.

      - At least 4 people have died in overnight shelling of Kharkiv by the Russian
      army. Another 17, including two children, were wounded.

      - Lithuanian trucks are still not allowed to leave Belarus, although the border
      crossings have been officially reopened.

      - Divers off the British coast discovered a Russian sonar buoy designed to track
      the movements of submarines.

      - German Chancellor Merz rejects Trump''s suggestion that Russia return to the
      G8.

      Turkish airspace near the border with Syria. De facto, it was a direct military
      confrontation between the Russian Federation and a NATO country. Did World War
      III start then? Did Russia invade Turkey in retaliation? Did it start bombing
      Turkish bases or cities? No, no and no. Nothing happened. Except that Russia
      turned tail at the time and never allowed itself a similar provocation against
      Turkey again. Because Russia has the mentality of a schoolboy who bullies his
      classmates in class. And he follows two laws: 1) He only ever dares to pick
      on the weakest. 2) He escalates his behaviour until he himself is slapped in
      the mouth. Unfortunately, we are desperately short of classmates in that imaginary
      classroom today who would be willing to keep these kinds of brats in line. And

      trillion roubles in the third quarter, according to the Russian Central Bank.
      Since the beginning of the year, debts that companies and individual entrepreneurs
      have not repaid on time have increased by 1.9 trillion roubles and by 600 billion
      roubles in the third quarter. A number of mining and metallurgical companies,
      hit by falling demand and prices for their products, have called for debt restructuring
      in recent months. Earlier, the oil and gas industry, which has faced sanctions
      and a sharp drop in oil prices, also had credit problems.

      - Reuters reports that nearly 200,000 Ukrainian citizens who have entered the
      United States since 2022 now risk losing their legal status. This is due to
      huge delays in processing extensions of stay - people can find themselves without
      valid documents literally overnight.

      - A meeting with national security advisers of the leaders of the UK, France
      and Germany took place in Switzerland. Another meeting followed with delegations
      from the US and Ukraine. Reuters reports that Rubio and Witkoff are on the ground
      for the US.

      - Rescue work has been completed in Ternopil - six people were never found under
      the rubble. All six, including one child, are listed as missing. That brings
      the total number of people killed in the Russian airstrike to 33. Ninety-four
      were injured, including 18 children.

      - According to a statement from the 7th Airborne Army Corps, Ukrainian forces
      have cleared the centre of Pokrovsk and are continuing to push Russian troops
      to the outskirts of the town. Fighting continues in the streets, but positions
      in the city centre remain under Ukrainian control.

      - Investigators believe that Yuri Sizov of the Russian GRU military intelligence
      unit No. 92154, also known as the 322nd Special Training Centre or "Senezh",
      and smuggler Yevgeny Ivanov are responsible for the recent sabotage on the Polish
      railway.

      - Budanov claims that Russian General Oleg Makarevich, who ordered the blowing
      up of the Kachovka hydroelectric plant, led an advisory mission in Venezuela,
      where more than 120 Russian instructors are now training the Venezuelan armed
      forces.

      - In Yakutia, due to "lack of budget funds", they have suspended the payment
      of bonuses for signing military contracts, although just a few months ago these
      payments were increased to 2.7 million rubles.

      - Personnel at Volkel air base in the Netherlands deployed ground weapons after
      spotting several unidentified drones over the base, but the drones disappeared
      before retaliation.

      - Trump said that if Zelensky rejects the current plan, "then he can continue
      to fight with all of his tiny forces".

      - The Ukrainians repeatedly hit the Russian Shatura power plant in the Moscow
      region overnight.

    desc: 'The "peace agreement" proposed by the US side takes on a bizarre context.
      According to Reuters, the Russians handed it over to the Americans at a secret
      meeting with Trump''s associates in Miami, Florida. This is confirmed by other
      politicians who, moreover, claim that it is not an American proposal at all,
      but only Russian conditions that the Americans were supposed to convey to their
      partners in Ukraine as intermediaries. The US Secretary of State, however, insists
      that this is a document co-authored by the United States and Ukraine, but adds
      in a roundabout way that it is not an ''American plan''. Ukrainian Minister
      Umerov is also said to have attended the meeting in Florida, but claims that
      he was not involved in the drafting of any document and that he was only told
      by the meeting participants that a document was being prepared. Some analysts
      therefore speculate that the Russians purposely leaked their proposal to the
      US media as an "American plan" in order to cause information chaos and panic.

      drug operation directly from Russia. Together with her Spanish accomplice, she
      chartered the Eser and sent it across the Atlantic under the Panamanian flag
      to transport 9 tonnes of cocaine. The plan had been carefully planned: the ship
      was to sail from Panama to Morocco and to be loaded with a huge consignment
      of cocaine in Venezuela. But the operation failed miserably. One of the crew
      died during the voyage and the captain was forced to dock in Cape Verde. There,
      police searched the ship and discovered the entire cargo. A Cape Verdean court
      has already sentenced 11 Russian sailors to 10-12 years in prison.

      - Serbian President Vucic has been accused of participating in a "sniper safari"
      in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war, in which wealthy foreigners allegedly paid

      - Putin has said that Russia completely occupied Kupyansk as early as November

      the same thing as Ukraine. So Putin, on the other hand, probably doesn''t have
      up-to-date information.

      - MP Nahornyak said that the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) will not

      were almost certainly written first in Russian and then translated into English.

      - Trump''s peace plan for Ukraine has met with bipartisan rejection in the US

      the US side. We agree to work on the points in the plan so that it leads to
      a just end to the war. In this context, let me make a few critical points. 1)
      While Ukraine is prepared to engage in meaningful negotiations to end this war
      - including at the level of leaders - our red lines are clear: There will never
      be any formal or other recognition of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied
      by the Russian Federation as Russian territory. Our country is not for sale.
      Ukraine will not accept any restrictions on its right to self-defence or on
      the size and capabilities of its armed forces. We will not tolerate any violation
      of our sovereignty, including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we
      wish to join. We will not reward the genocidal intentions underlying Russian
      aggression by undermining our identity, including our language. 2) Peace requires
      enhanced security and sustained financial assistance to Ukraine. Strengthening
      Ukraine''s defence capabilities is not escalation - it is the only way to get
      Russia to engage constructively in international peace efforts. In this regard,
      we express our deep gratitude to all partners and allies. 3) The Kremlin regime
      will not stop unless it is stopped. There is only one realistic way to end this
      war: Russia must be forced to retreat - economically, politically and militarily."

    detail: '- Russia has started testing a new measure: when anyone returns to the
      country from abroad, their SIM card is disconnected from mobile internet and
      SMS for 24 hours. The same happens if the card has been inactive for more than
      72 hours. Russia hopes this will prevent Ukrainians from using Russian mobile
      networks to control and guide remote drones.

      - According to Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia is ready to negotiate
      with the United States to resume preparations for a meeting between Putin and
      Trump. But Lavrov also called the Ukrainian president a "Nazi" and warned that
      if a nuclear power conducts nuclear tests, Russia will do the same.

      - A C-130 military transport plane crashed in Georgia en route from Azerbaijan.
      Turkish and Azerbaijani military personnel were reportedly on board. The cause
      of the crash is unknown, but according to videos on social media, the machine
      broke apart in flight.

      - In Moscow''s "Obruchevsky" social care home, a 20-year-old woman suffering
      from epilepsy and a tendency to self-harm had to have both arms amputated after
      being restrained with woollen stockings "so she could not hurt herself" - and
      then forgotten by staff.

      - A court in Minsk has branded the website of opposition politician Syarhei
      Tsikhanousky and all his social media accounts - Telegram, Twitter, Facebook,
      YouTube and Instagram - as "extremist material".

      - Ukrainian forces withdrew from five villages along the contact line on the
      Zaporizhzhya front. There is nothing left to defend after incessant Russian
      airstrikes and shelling.

      - India''s five largest refineries, which together account for two-thirds of
      the country''s oil imports, have not placed a single order for Russian crude
      for December.

      - In the latest survey, 56% of Russians said they were "tired of war", with
      another 27% agreeing somewhat. Only 20% of Russians support the continuation
      of the war.

      - Almost all Ukrainian regions are facing long emergency power cuts, lasting
      up to 12 hours in some places, due to Russian state terror.

      - More than 600 soldiers from Russia''s Central Military District are reported
      to have died as a result of drugs, suicide and alcohol.

      - The Russians are again dressing their diversionary troops near Pokrovsk in
      civilian clothes to infiltrate behind Ukrainian lines.

      - In the Ulyanovsk region of Russia, mobile internet has been completely shut
      down until the end of the "special military operation".

      - About 70% of the artillery ammunition fired by the Russians now comes from
      North Korea.

      - The Russian Federation plans to take in tens of thousands of workers from
      India and other Asian countries.

      - Sudan pulls out of deal to build Russian naval base

      - Romania reports that a Russian drone landed on its territory last night.

      - Ukrainian drones landed on a refinery near Saratov.

      - The Russian refinery Orsknefteorgsintez is on fire near Orsk.

    title: Tuesday
    year: 11 November 2025
    desc: 'Ukrainian customs officers foiled an attempt to smuggle 14,487 stamps depicting
      Hitler and swastikas from Poland into Ukraine. This was reported by the State
      Customs Service of Ukraine itself. The smuggled stamps were found hidden among
      used clothes at the Shehyni-Medyka border crossing. Import of similar items
      is prohibited under the Ukrainian law on propaganda of totalitarian regimes.
      Why such a shipment was heading to Ukraine is probably well imagined by readers
      of this page. In fact, the customs officers did not just thwart the smuggling,
      but probably another attempt by Russian propaganda to portray Ukraine as a state
      full of Nazis. And this is what happened:
